# Mean: a measure of center
Most useful over data with a [[Symmetric Distribution]]
Found via an arithmetic average over every entry in the dataset

$$\overline{X}=\frac{\sum^{n}_{i-1}{X_i}}{n}$$
Where $\overline{X}$ represents the mean.


Here are test scores from 5 students: $79, 82, 94, 83, 92$
The mean of this data is
$$\frac{79+82+94+83+92}{5} = 86$$
The mean is also used to calculate [[Standard Deviation]].

Compared to [[Median]]: more useful on Symmetric Data, used with Standard Deviation.
