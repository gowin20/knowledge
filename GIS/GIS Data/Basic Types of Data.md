### Topic: Data, Information, and Geographic Data

Data vs Information

What is Data?

- Facts
- Singular: Datum
- Length of trouts, temperature of LA, any points of datum

Types of Data

- Spatial / Geospatial / Geographic
    - Aspects of objects that allow us to **define** location on Earth
    - Latitude & Longitude, Street Address, Places of Interest, etc.
    - REQUIRED for all GIS
- Attribute Data
    - Used to describe data that is found in particular locations on earth
    - Information about your home, roommates, pretty much anything
    - Complements Spatial Data

**SUMMARY: Geographic and Attribute Data complement each other. Geographic is required, while Attribute Data tells us more about the Geographic location the Geographic Data describes**
