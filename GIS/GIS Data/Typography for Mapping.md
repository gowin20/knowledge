Choice of type impacts:

- personality
- order of features
- legibility

Should change the type in some way for pretty much every map

## Elements of a Letter

![[Typography for Mapping/Untitled.png]]

**Stroke**

- Lines that combine to create a letter
- width is variable

**Serifs**

- finishing strokes on the end of letters. basically like "feet"
- Two categories: serif and sans-serif

**Terminals**

- ending strokes, usually found on sans serif fonts

**Baseline**

- imaginary line that the letters sit on

**Cap height**

- height of capital ledges with straight edges

**X Height**

- height of lowercase letters

**Descender, Ascender**

- pieces that extend far above and below the baseline and cap/x height respectively

**Counter**

- areas closed within letters (e, o, p)

**Bowl**

- rounded part of the letter that makes the shape (e, a, etc). subset of counters

# Font Categories

### Text Fonts

good for:

- small size
- continuous reading
- labels

Includes both serif and sans serif, not overly decorative

### Display

decorative fonts. be careful using these due to reading difficulty

- avoid in map body, sometimes alright in a title

### Serif Fonts

Small finishing strokes

- distinguish letters, legibility
- slab serifs aren't good for small labels (blockier serifs)

### Sans Serif Fonts

Great for on-screen viewing

### Monospace Fonts

Disproportional spacing

- same space (aka width) for each label)
- often used for computer coding, terminal fonts
- NOT good for map labels

## Choosing a Good Font

Stick to only 2 or 3 fonts if possible

(one serif and one sans serif depending on the map's purpose)

A good font choice should:

1. Define the map's purpose and personality
    - formal, informal, modern, classic, etc
2. Fit the map and complement each other

### Tips:

- Fonts with larger x-heights increase legibility
- Thicker strokes stay legible on detailed backgrounds
- thin strokes are hard to read in coarse resolutions
- Remember letterforms, serifs, terminals for legibility

Example: the word *Illinois* in 4 different fonts

## Using, Sharing Fonts

Just look online man

fontsquirrel.com

Examples of fonts installed on computer: flippingtypical.com

In order to make sure fonts display on another user's computer, need installed font

- export to PDF and embed fonts as a workaround

## Label Sizes

Different fonts have different sizes (X height, etc) even at the same point size

Fucking annoying! have to keep this in mind

keep final map size in mind when picking label sizes. print mode helps with that

# More Terms

**Kerning:** space between individual letters

![[Typography for Mapping/Untitled 8.png]]

**Tracking**: all spaces for the group of text

Tracking is used to fill space, increase legibility when labels are small/large

Line Spacing (AKA Leading)

- Space between two lines of text
- Measured in: distance between baselines, percentage of point size, absolute measures
- decreased leading size helps in crowded areas

## Type Effects

**Callouts**

- use graphics to link label to a point

![[Typography for Mapping/Untitled 11.png]]

**Shadows**

- increase legibility, especially on busy background
- copy of text with offset
- only use a slight offset with a contrasting color

**Halos**

- letter casing or stroke outlining letters (letter buffers)
- better when thin and subtle
