focusing on the DEMOCRATIC party because i'm not a loser

- [x]  overall summary of voting behavior's spatial distribution
    - [x]  calculate Global Moran I values
- [x]  3 univariate LISA maps. Show statistically signifigant spatial clusters for each of these:
    - [x]  2016 election results
    - [x]  2020 election results
    - [x]  change in vote share from 2016 to 2020
        - variable was generated by subtracting the 2016 one from the 2020 one
- [x]  strategically discuss the maps above!
    - where are clusters present?
    - what are regions with clusters like?
    - what does this mean for candidates going forward?
- [x]  directional local autocorrelation analysis
    - (comparing variable values from both elections with spatially lagged values from both elections)
    - compare variable values from both elections, with spatially lagged values from both elections
    - [ ]  origin-standardized scatter plot
    - [x]  discussion about spatial dynamics indicated by this analysis
    - [x]  strategic conclusions
