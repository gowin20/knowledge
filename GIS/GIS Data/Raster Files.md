- DEM - digital elevation model
    - A Raster dataset
    - Lowest + highest elevation is provided for reference
    - CoNED TBDEM
    - STRM Void-Filled
    - "download NetCDF File"
- Raster Algebra
    - Calculations by performing mathematical operations on the values

Tobler's First Law of Geography:

- "everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things"

### Types of Raster Operations

- Local operations, or per-cell functions, compute a raster output dataset where the output value at each location (cell) is a function of the value associated with that location on one or more raster datasets.
- Neighborhood
- Global
    - Global, or per-raster, operations compute an output raster dataset in which the output value at each cell location is potentially a function of all the cells combined
- Zonal
