Topic: Scale (in-depth) and Data Measurement Scales

### Recall

The multiple different types of scale convey different meanings. Geographic Scale and Cartographic Scale have their Large/Small stuff FLIPPED, somewhat counter-intuitively

# Types of Scales

#### Map Scale:
- The extent of a study area
- From Large to Small:
    - Global ↔ Regional ↔ Urban ↔ Local ↔ Individual


#### Cartographic Scale:
See [[Cartographic Scale]]


# Data Measurement Scales

- Nominal / Categorical Scale
    - Land use, and how we classify and categorize land
    - Broad Descriptions we use for measuring data
- Ordinal Scale
    - Categorization AND an ordering / ranking
    - Order in terms of importance or preference
- Interval Scale
    - Arbitrary Zero
    - Numeric in Data
- Ratio Scale
    - All of the characteristics of the interval level, plus a NON-arbitrary zero (meaningful)
    - ex. All of the information covered in a census, such as number of married couples or ethnic breakdowns

Accuracy
- How close a measurement is to the true value
- Is your watch set to the correct time?

Precision

- How close multiple measurements are to each other
- Does the second hand on your watch correspond to exactly one second?
