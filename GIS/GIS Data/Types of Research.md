### What is Research?

Nomothetic Research

- Developing Laws and Theories about things

Idiographic Research

- Particular and Individual cases

Each type of research returns information, which can inform the other type of research

Basic vs Applied Research

- Basic
    - Understand something
    - Produce knowledge
    - ex. "When did the Universe begin?" "Why did my wife leave?"
- Applied
    - Solving a problem (or many)
- Geographic Scale of research
    - Refers to the level of relevance for research
    - Different Scales:
        - Universal
        - Global
        - Continental
        - Hemispheric
        - Country
        - State
        - Region
        - Urban
        - Local
        - Individual
        - Atomic
    - Global
        - (Nomothetic)
    - Local
        - (Idiographic)
- Unit of Analysis for research
    - Different units are used for different scales of research (people, counties, etc.)

### Types of Research

We categorize research according to its purpose

- Exploratory Research
    - knowledge for knowledge's sake
    - Used to test the feasibility of more rigorous studies
    - Small-scale
- Descriptive Research
    - describe a phenomena or process
    - ex. Census data, crime rates in cities, deforestation, etc.
    - Often used in larger research
- Explanatory Research
    - Identify the reasons behind phenomena or processes
    - "why is this deforestation happening?" "why is climate change goin on"
    - Subcategories:
        - Qualitative
            - Very broad, qualitative writing and explanations
        - Quantitative
            - Mathematical models for observational data
- Theoretical Research
    - Developing and testing theories that researchers have
- Empirical Research
    - The means by which people develop and test theories
