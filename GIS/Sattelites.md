# High Resolution Sattelites

High Resolution Imagery: 1m resolution allowing us to see incredible detail

**IKONOS:** commercial sattelite
- Panchromatic 1x1m
- Pan-sharpened multispectral 4x4m

**Panchromatic:** covers the entire electromagnetic spectrum


WorldView-1, WorldView-2, Geoeye-1


# Coarse Resolution Sattelites
**NOAA GOES Geostationary sattelite**
Remember NOAA? National Oceanic A A
- image of earth every 8 minutes
- 8km resolution: highly coarse!
- only one static spot
- mostly used for weather - almost all weather models based on GOES sattelites
