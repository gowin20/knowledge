# The Spiritual Power of Cacao




Let's talk about Cacao. This plant seems like the perfect excuse to bring people together. What initially drew me to Cacao was Raury's instagram, specifically the way it seems like he's built such an amazing community of people who all seem to be genuinely happy. 

Advocates of cacao praise its energizing and mind-opening properties, which indeed seem to be real. The plant contains lots of theobromine, with many parallels to caffeine. It also contains anandamide, the so-called "bliss molecule", which supposedly induces euphoric and heart-opening effects.

Even if it does really work, I suspect a large part of the appeal is placebo. Or rather, it's the belief. Placebo implies skepticism, but I genuinely believe it's an amazing experience which can be fostered with intention in order to deepen connection with other people. It's something that at this point I'm quite excited about.

## Ritual Ceremony
I have a vision of what this will be. We'll set up a ritual altar on the ground, of circular shape. Cacao cups will sit on the altar, along with certain plants pleasantries to deepen connection with nature and imbue spiritual aura. We'll burn incense, play music - preferably live - and prepare the cacao together in an aesthetic way. Taking the first sips, we'll state our intentions together and imbue them into the cacao. Each subsequent sip will be empowered by community, representing gratefulness and delivering ability to the consumer. It's not just the cacao at that point, but the combined energy of all inhabitants of the space.

What activities would the group partake in during this ritual?

## Deep Romantic Experience
I also intend to enjoy Cacao in community with Shreya specifically. This is how I'd like to try it for the first time, then maybe try it alone as well before the ritual begins. I think this could be a wonderful and intentional time for us. The purpose of Cacao is to deepen connections and share genuine moments with other people. We'll approach it from a place of love and acceptance, with no expectations but intentions of bonding.

What activities would Shreya and I partake in during this ritual?


## Individual Spiritial Journey
I'm really looking forward to this as well. Instead of drinking coffee, I'll prepare Cacao in the morning, keep it in my thermos, and go on a walk to the most nature I can find. Possibly the botanical garden? Though honestly, my head always goes to the area by holly/gardenia, then hitting campus through there and seeing nature in that way. I'd aim to spend about an hour on my walk, returning energized and grateful for the wonderful environment. I just wish I could do this in NASHVILLE! At the Warner Parks.

During this ritual, I will appreciate nature and set intentions for my day.
