# What is a Method?

## Java vs Python

A method is just like a function in Python. They do the same things

- Run a set block of code when called
- Take inputs

They're different in some ways

- Have an explicitly defined type
- Can be public or private
- should always return something, except void

## Parameters, Types

- Have to explicitly define the types of the parameters, as well as the type of the method itself
- You can use the method as you would a variable of the same type
- If you don't want the method to return anything, make it of type 'void'
- methods must return the same type that they are defined as
