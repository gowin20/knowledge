### Notes

Database - an integrates set of data

- Spatial DBs contain geospatial information components
- Database Management System (DBMS) is a set of tools and applications that permit collection, storage, retrieval, manipulation, indexing, securing, sharing, and analysis of data (+ more!)

Made up of tables

- Rows contain records, cases, or observations
- Columns contain attributes and variables
- Key Identifier / Primary Key
    - A column containing values which uniquely identify a row

### Topology in Tables

representing spatial objects in tables allows us to store information about this stuff

- Connectivity
- Adjacency
- Nesting
- Hierarchy

Maps can be thought of as specific X/Y coordinate points, stored in a table

Polygon-Arc Topology
