### Recall

### Notes

- Location
    - The position of something relative to something else, usually along a line
    - Needs a frame of reference
- Direction
    - North
        - True North
            - Location where the axis of the earth's rotation intersects with the earth
        - Magnetic North
            - Magnetic Sphere
            - Not the same as True North
            - Magnetic Declination: the magnetic north moves over time
        - Grid North
            - The north we find on any map
            - usually the top edge of the map itself
- Distance
    - The amount of separation between location
    - Measured nominally (relative positions like near or far) OR
    - Measured absolutely (miles, kilometers)
    - Oftentimes distorted due to map projections
- Space
    - Abstract and generic
    - Something contained within a border
    - Something filled by stuff / patterns / processes
    - Something described by keywords like public, private, static, etc.
    - A general area of interest
    - **GIS: Topological Space**
        - Topology: how places + locations are connected to each other in space
        - Are locations connected to each other? What rules govern spacial relationships?
        - The "connectivity" of a space
        - Think about subway maps, airline network maps
        - Levels of specificity: cities, counties, states, countries, etc.
- Navigation
    - Destination oriented travel
    - Motor Skills + moving through space
    - Mental Maps + geographic awareness
    - Technology helps us immensely with this task
- Geographic Knowledge Stages
    - Landmark Knowledge
    - Route Knowledge
    - Survey Knowledge
