# Point Symbols:

Smaller size: smaller data values

Larger size: larger data values

### Proportional vs Graduated Circles

![[Field Knowledge/GIS/GIS Data/Mapping with Symbols/Untitled 2.png]]

Proportional == unclassed, graduated == classed

### Proportional Symbols: Flannery Compensation

Slightly adjust symbol sizes due to common underestimation issues! areas scale on a square so we underestimate it lol

Make sure to set the **scaling factor!** Scale to easily distinguish classes, but with the least amount of overlap

Point symbology can show qualatative differences between things

## Selecting Good Map Symbols

Use oriented symbols to show orientation in things like wind direction, etc

## Lines

Size: width, size of lines based on importance

Pattern: change spacing, shape and length of pattern to differentiate

## Area

Pattern

- use easy to comprehend patterns
- Coarse â†’ Fine to show heirarchy
- Higher value == larger shapes, closer spacing
- Different shape == different qualitative feature

# Dot Density

Each dot is a spepcific value

Fill enumeration units with randomly placed dots
