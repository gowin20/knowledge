# What is GPS?

[[GIS & GPS]]

**Global Positioning Systems**

Used quite often in conjunction with GIS

- umbrella term referring to the broader universe of **navigation systems**

GPS Specifically is American. It uses a constellation of **24 Satellites** to figure out location, elevation, speed, and direction on planet earth. Constantly orbiting!

- Latitude, Longitude are derived this way

Used on devices: mobile phones, etc

Other positioning Systems:

- GLONASS - RUSSIAN GPS, uses their own satellites ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º
- GALILEO - European GPS, uses their own satellites as well ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º
- GPS - Developed by the US Department of Defense for military use ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

When it was originally introduced to the general public, they put deliberate ERRORS into the software to make sure it didn't work perfectly. Called Selective Availability

- Cell Towers
- Hybrid Positioning Systems (uses wifi, etc as well as GPS)
- Indoor navigation! GPS doesn't really work indoors, so this is a big growing field right now
