Of the form A2345 of the suit (a specific type of Straight Flush)
            
There are 5 cards to choose from. Since our selection includes all five cards every time, and order does not matter, the total number of ways to choose 5 cards is 

$$ C(5,5) $$




There are 4 suits in a traditional deck of cards. Since all cards must be of the same suit, the number of options is \(C(4,1)\).
            
Thus, the total number of hands (by the multiplication principle) is 
            
   $$ C(5,5) * C(4,1) = 4 \: hands $$
