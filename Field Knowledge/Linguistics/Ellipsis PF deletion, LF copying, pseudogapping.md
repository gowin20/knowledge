### PF Deletion & LF Copying

- 2 general approaches
1. **LF Copying** -> the silent material is syntactically a silent VP pronoun w no internal structure, whose meaning is recovered from the antecedent at Logical Form
2. **PF Deletion** -> the understood material is fully present at S structure, but the phonological content is not said at Phonetic Form
    - the phonemes are deleted, but the words themselves were there at S structure

### Strict vs. Sloppy Readings - LF Copying

```
John will slap himself and Bill will too.

```

- could mean -> Bill will slap John (strict reading)
- could mean -> Bill will slap himself (sloppy reading)
- for PF deletion, the S structure should look like this
`John will slap himself and Bill will slap himself too`
    - this can never yield the sloppy reading
    - can’t yield the strict reading either, since John is not the domain of the second “himself”
- LF can account for both derivations though, just differ in the order in which you fill stuff in
    - the meanings of not only VPs but also reflexives, DPs, etc, get filled in as well by copying an antecedent -> crucial assumption behind this

    **Example we did on the homework:** 

    ```jsx
    Greta loves her father and Astrid does too. 
    ```

### Strict vs. Sloppy Readings - PF Deletion

- the way to account for strict vs. sloppy in PF deletion are two ways: accidental co-reference and the bound variable reading
    - accidental co-reference reading: the index of the pron in the elided VP matches the index of the antecedent
    - bound variable: subject trace and pronoun have the same index, pronoun is bound to the closest subject essentially

    **Example we did on the homework:** 

    ```jsx
    Irena loves her brother and Marcus does too. 
    ```

### Pseudogapping

```jsx
Darin hasn't eaten squid, but Raia has ~~eaten~~ octopus. 
```

- eliding only the verb portion of the VP, keeping the direct object
- how do we explain this?
- new structure!!
    - vPs and Args
- the main point here is that since the DO now moves up, we can elide the VP before verb movement upwards, and then get this pseudogapping structure
- if we want to elide the whole VP still, we just elide the top vP
