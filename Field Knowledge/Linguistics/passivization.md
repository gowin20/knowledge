Normal, active verbs have a little vP which assigns case to the specifier of its complement. That means that Spec-AgrOP/AgrIOP is a position 

# passivization

- verb that takes an external and at least one internal argument
- prevents external argument from being in SPEC vP
- removes the verb's ability to assign Case in SPEC vP
- requires there to be a "be" in the sentence, right on top of the highest vP
- usually allows a PP adjunct to the main verb that starts w "by"
    - eg "by Mary", "by John"
    - person that the action was done by

```jsx
Chris ate the hotdog -> The hotdog was eaten by Chris
```

- the first DP complement needs to move all the way to Spec TP to get Case, since the verb does not assign Case so there are no other options
- since there is a difference between the way that this CAUS works vs. CAUS in a non-passive sentence, we say there are two types of CAUS
    - CAUS active = CAUS in non passive sentences, theta role and case assigner
    - CAUS passive = doesn't do shit

### example trees

`the glass was broken by mary`

- PP clause "by" is just an adjunct to the verb

`the homework is always graded by Tom`

- here, there's both CAUS and BECOM, create this v head in the way that you would normally
- passivization does not change the v head

`a ball might have been kicked`

### example on the hw

- why is this wrong?
- "him" is not getting Case in Spec Agr OP, needs to move all the way up to TP of the whole sentence to get Case
- passive verb "considered" does not give Case in the Spec Agr OP
