- looks like it uses TERNARY branching
- the first complement c-commands the second, but **not** vice versa
- we can use little V to explain this!

But, WHY STOP HERE!?

- "have" might not even be a primitive relation. instead, let's use GO(poss),== undergo change of possession

### GO: Undergo a change of possession

### GO-INFO: Information (intangible) undergo a change of possession

GO-INFO â†’ tell / -RECIP-CAUS

AgrIOP: Indirect Object Agreement Phrase

- "Goal"/"Recipient" gets Case

AgrOP

- Theme gets Case

### RECIP: little v signifying recipient, can assign Case

Passivization only targets v CAUS, and NOT v RECIP. That means that only the indirect object can become the subject of a Passive
