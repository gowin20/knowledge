[[first therapy appointment]]

I put myself under a lot of pressure in all aspects of my life, and I've been struggling with anxiety and periodic panic attacks for years. A string of recent events has really elevated my stress and anxiety, and sent me into a bout of depression.

Someone I didn't know that well reached out to me at the end of winter quarter and informed me they were planning on killing themselves the next morning. I was the one to call CAPS, and provided her address and contact info which resulted in her being arrested and admitted to a hospital against her will.

Further back, over winter break several unfortunate things happened in a row. I got a citation in Oklahoma on a road trip for minor possession of marijuana, I finally separated myself from my former friend group in my hometown because of recurring issues with them, and I found out some awful stuff about my uncle. All of this combined with COVID has heightened my anxiety and caused me to become pretty depressed
