option to easily visually link your cards together

they all appear in space with each other - basically you can place each block wherever you want
literally a world created out of ideas
could eventually make it really complicated, amazing, and epic looking
so amazing
so much work created by people
but it looks like a physical landscape you can walk through
interactive space online where the terrain you explore is all media. you can look and stuff but also interact

you can use arrow keys to move closer and further away from people

this could work especially well as a CHAT ROOM

the video you see is a feed of your friends' videos like zoom, discord, etc. However, you can use the arrow keys to move around. Videos are attached to player characters, and proximity chat makes users' audio feeds louder the closer they are to the other people. 
People can also set their volume, allowing global communication or simply different radii of audibility
Could either do 
- true proximity chat, where audibility decreases continuously based on distance
- basic proximity, where your audibility is at a set range from your character with an abrupt cutoff
Honestly the basic one could definitely be more fun and intuitive for users. Plus, it's easier to code
