take the old maps I used for my website last year, and begin tracing them using adobe illustrator. Transform and clean them up to attain a minimalist vibe, then attempt to modernize the map in some way (replace buildings with skyscrapers perhaps, boats become tech like phones that are swimming in the ocean idk)

i could do this with several maps, but it'd be best to start with that classic Roman map.
