Thermal Remote Sensing
- single band

Forward Looking Infrared
- reflected light


### Thermal Infrared Wavelengths

**Reflective** region: 0.7-3.0um
- short enough wavelength to behave like visible light

**Thermal** infrared: 3-14



midterm: what is the visible wavelength?
what is the blue wavelength?
