incorporate linguistic variation in links to phrases. For example, I want to link to a page called [[look at again]], corresponding to a certain concept I'm talking about.

However, the nature of English is such that I'll also want to link it in other phrases naturally in my writing, for example [[look at it again]], [[look at them again]], etc.

It would be cool and maybe not that difficult to write a plugin, which looks at phrases and offers to link them if they are linguistically similar to the name of an existing page.

Obviously easy and extant with exact matches, but using a little bit of linguistic analysis could absolutely make it possible to link similar phrases as well

link all of
- across multiple devices
- across devices
- multiple devices

link
- change of location
- change my location
- etc


My intuition is that is actually difficult. It'd be an undertaking to write a program that actually offers useful results. It's one of those tasks which would take a ton of fine-tuning, or else basically every note would return. Using syntax trees / fstas would make it a lot more accurate, I bet
