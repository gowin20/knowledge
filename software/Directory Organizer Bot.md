I'm finding it hard recently to focus on the "organizational" aspect of my life. I'm supposed to revamp the notion, organize my own notion, organize this vault, sync the vaults and everything across it, honestly a lot of work

it would be so cool to build an organizer bot! that process could totally be automated once ai is sufficient enough

a bot could observe the way you organize directories, and attempt to mimick it in schemas you apply it to.

There wouldn't be very many sample cases, so I think the bot would have to be trained to a high level already. It could set control points and look at each subtree as well. It seems to me like humans usually have different types of folders, like different formats of content, which changes based on the level of the tree you're at. A bot would start by looking at the current folder's content and noting the names, then recurse and do that for every directory possible.

then, it would have to undergo an analysis step where it searched for patterns at a higher level in the data. Based on patterns found, it would encode them into a matrix later used for decision-making

it would probably be easy to encode "sequences" of directories and their shape, in order to keep track of patterns. These sequences could be of arbitrary length - from 1 directory to many - and in this directory engine's mind then would serve as the basic building blocks of folder systems it builds.

When the data provided is vastly expanded, I would expect a clear "best directory system" to emerge. However, this might not be the case! Maybe it's somewhat arbitrary, and really is totally dependent on the person. My intuition is that most people don't spend that much time thinking about the way they organize their files. It's easy to use the default divisions (documents / photos / games / etc) that come with windows. However, lots and lots of people do, so I wonder how similar everyone's are.

either way though, it would be cool to find out. That would be a cool bot to make.
