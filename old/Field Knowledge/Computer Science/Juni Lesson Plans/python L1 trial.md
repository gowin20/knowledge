=========================================================================================================
PYTHON CHECKLIST

```
Introductions, 

background information

Ask them how much they know about computer science
	Programming language
	Python?

share your screen

We're gonna be making something using computer graphics today (graphics == digital art)

Show them the final project! (<https://repl.it/@JuniLearning/GrS1-Spirals>)

 Repl.it setup
	Explain what the left and right sides of the screen are

Turtles - little doods we can tell to walk around our screen

Import

Make a new Turtle

How to give our guy instructions
Make the turtle move, turn

ask if they want to Slow him down so we can see (if they're confused)

Make a triangle? what about twenty more (introduce loops)

Spiral looks like a bunch of triangles, but isn't perfect. If you look really closely, the turtle never completes any of them. It always overshoots where it started by a little bit. 
	How could we change our existing code to make this effect?

Make the spiral cooler (colors, size, location)

Make more spirals!!! (another, bigger for loop)

```

python lesson

ask some stuff about them

same sharescreen stuff

Ask them about:

Coding
Python
Art
Graphics

graphics = digital art

help them make an account on replit

before we start, show them the end result

all commands for turtles use the turtle's name and a dot, then the function

function = another word for a command, we can tell the dood to do a function

define what strings are

explain:
import
turtles
for loops
strings
random
variables

make a turtle
have it move around
set some properties of it
put it in a loop
make one successful spiral

TURTLE COMMANDS
parens () after every function call
turtle.Turtle()
n.speed
n.color
n.penup
n.pendown
n.forward
n.right
n.left
n.goto

RANDOM COMMANDS
random.randint(lower, upper)

GENERAL CODING FUNDAMENTALS
for loops: for loop in range(50):
variables: x = 5
import stuff
