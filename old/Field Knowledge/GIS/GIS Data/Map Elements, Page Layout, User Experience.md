What are maps?

Mental Maps - we generally see things in relation to where we are, and where we want to go. This is a self-centered view

Transition to a geocentric view: objective view including things like cardinal directions, etc.

## Cartographic Maps

VIsual depictions of the environment

- Modtly 2d
- Most commonly viewed on computers today

Four main characteristics to these:

1. Use vertical, oblique views (not like street view)
2. All have a Scale, corresponding to real life
3. Created using specific projections which distort reality in set ways
4. Generalizations, Symbolizations based on what we want to represent

Need at least one of these to be considered cartogrpahic!

## Map Transformation

Environment → Information/Data → Map → Map Image

Map → Map image is like transitioning from ArcMap to a pretty PDF

Usable maps should answer these questions:

1. Why?
2. Where?
3. Who?
4. What?
5. How?

Good maps:

- Are easily understood, with a clear message
- Do not mislead, and represent data accurately
- Fit the output format and are used as intended
- Attract the reader's attention to the important information
- Are well-presented and attractive
- Can stand alone without supplemental information

# Map Layout

- Balance empty areas!
- Limit the amount of boxes
- Keep similar items close to each other
- Align items for good visual balance
- Experiment with the layout! Keep trying different things to see what works best
