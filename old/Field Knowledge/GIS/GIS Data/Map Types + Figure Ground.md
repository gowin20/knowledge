# Figure Ground

Preceptual phenomenon in psychology. We visually identify a figure to focus on and distinguish that from background

- The ability of us to distinguish figures from the background
- Where do our maps draw attention to?

**Give visual prominence to the most important things, depending on the purpose of the map!**

Title and main map = most important!

Marginal elements = least important!
