g-products:

- permutations in the style of cross products over the entire vector. every possible combination in cross product style tried
- use only the useful ones
- this is how we create associations with objects inside an artificial mind
- our own "star" operator. keeps running continuously with printed updates or something
- use the useful outputs of this in order to style some kind of thought
- "using useful" is hard. Need some way to recognize valid relationships between things
- positive reinforcement learning by attempting a task over and over again
- teaches machines on a specific task
