# What is Acting?

- Learning your lines
- Learning what "choices" to make as an actor

Very literary. All about words! (and feelings)

everything is a celebration - even war, funerals, anything in a group

there is no culture that has ever arisen out of Atheism

atheism is nothing man. It just means you don't want to be a part of the culture that does exist

neutral speech

- newscasters are taught to speak in Transatlantic English
- no regionalisms!

figure out how to "gut" the audience first, then work backwards from there

what is your mic drop moment?
