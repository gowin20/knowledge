# What is Solo Performance Writing?

justified resentment

- the fear that we won't be able to connect with ourselves and write
- you resent having to put yourselves in the position to write. you have to surrender yourself to the flow and accept that you don't know what will happen
- justify reasoning to do something else
- writing is a form of telepathy. We don't write because we fear the telepathy isn't going to work

solution: do a bad version first
