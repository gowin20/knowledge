### only / also association

- *only* is always an adjoined Adv

![[old/Field Knowledge/Linguistics/C-command NPI, also only, binding theory/Untitled.png]]

- *only* can only (lol) appear in certain configurations
- given a particular placement of *only* in a sentence, we are concerned with what the possible associates are for *only*
- *only* evokes an associate, and a contrast set, which is a collection of alternatives to the associate which would make the sentence false if substituted for the associate
    - `John only read ANIMAL FARM`
    - “animal farm” is the associate, as indicated by the caps
    - contrast set would be something like “1984, of mice and men, wuthering heights”
- *only* *must c-command its associate at S-structure*

```
Only JOHN likes fish = no one but john likes fish
	-- possible sentence because "only" c-commands John

Only John envies MARY = Mary is the only one john envies
	-- this meaning does not make sense, because "only" does not c-command Mary

```

- *also* is much more permissive than only, in its placement and connection to associates
- *also* must c-command its associate but it can c-command in D-structure

### NPIs

- some words that need negation to precede them, eg, yet -> `John has NOT finished his homework yet`
- negation is called the **licenser**, the actual word itself called **negative polarity item**
- *licenser must c-command the NPI at S-structure*
- DPs containing negative quantifies, eg “No guest”, license NPis
    - the whole DP counts
- people often think of *any* as a NPI
    - sometimes it is: `Do you know any single women` but sometimes it’s not: `you can pick any sweater`
    - test: if you can put almost before it, making it “almost any”, and that makes sense, it’s NOT an NPi
        - `Do you know almost any single women?` vs. `you can pick almost any sweater`

### pronominal binding

`every boy(i) likes his(i) mother`

- if a pronoun has a quantified expression as an antecedent, the antecedent must c-command the pronoun

### our new binding theory

- principle A: binding domain of an anaphor is the smallest XP that contains the anaphor and contains a specifier, and contains a DP that c-commands the anaphor, and contains the antecedent of every head trace that the XP contains
- *principle B:* binding domain of a pronoun is the smallest XP that contains the pronoun and contains a specifier and contains the antecedent one very head trace the XP contains
