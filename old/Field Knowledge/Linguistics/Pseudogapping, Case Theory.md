# Pseudogapping

Related to VP Ellipsis

> Darin hasn't eaten squid, but Raia has ~~eaten~~ octopus

- octopus is a DP - should be part of VP! However, it's not being elided

we could theorize that it's just the V head being elided, but other cases prove otherwise:

> The lawyer can't prove Paul innocent but he can ~~prove~~ Delia ~~innocent~~

"prove innocent" doesn't seem to be a constituent that excludes Delia, so this looks super fucking weird!

**MAJOR MOVES INCOMING!**

Suppose that the SURFACE DIRECT OBJECT POSITION is not sister of V, but rather specifier of a functional head X above VP, with verb normally head-raising past that position to another functional head Y

- so, 2 new phrases XP and YP in order to properly capture pseudogapping + other weirdness
- originate ABOVE VP. The verb originates in VP, then moves up to YP
- we'll give better names to XP and YP later

- The verb moves to Spec-YP in the same manner as subjects move to Spec-TP

This makes sense to me because VERBS are the most important part of a sentence by far. Everything else is kinda built on top of them

Pseudogapping elides the VP after it the object has moved, but before the verb has

Replaces the previous structure for raising to object!

- Phrasal movement is now always to a specifier position

- Traditional VP Ellipsis is now **ellipsis of YP**
- YP now goes where VP used to go, all the other stuff is above it
    - negations, auxilliaries, etc, are above

# Case Theory

In addition to the EPP, there seems to be an additional requirement that a DP must move to exactly one of a special set of positions known as **Case Positions**

Languages with case morphology exhibit this behavior:

- subject of finite clause is nominative
- direct ovject of active transitive verb is accusative
- object of preposition is in one of various non-nominative cases
- specifier of possessive DP is genitive

English pronoun system has these same generalizations:

- I / *Me / *My like him
- She likes me / *I / *my
- She gave it to him / *he / *his
- This is my / *I / *me book

Hypothesis:
A DP must have found itself in a case position **by s-structure** in order to be happy

### The Case Filter: Each DP must receive exactly one Case by s-structure

What does it mean to "receive a case?"

- it happens when the DP has been in one of the designated Case positions

**Filter**: a condition such that if it's not satisfied, the representation is ungrammatical. "filters out" invalid sentences

### Case Positions in English

1. Subject position: **spec of finite TP** (NOT nonfinite TP)
2. Object Case position of a transitive V: **Spec of XP** (NOT complement of V!)
3. **Complement of P**
4. **Spec-DP when D is an apostrophe** ('s) - a possessor or genitive position
5. Spec of **infinitival TP**, when that TP is **complement to the complementizer *for***

    > [For John to leave] would upset Mary.

6. The **second object position** of a double object verb

    > I gave Mary money.         I sent Chris flowers.

**Corollary:** Movement of a DP from a Case position to another Case position is ruled out!

> *John seems [that *t* is happy].

> *I believe Mary [that *t* is happy].

- no problem when you move to a non-Case position!
- A-bar movment is NEVER to a Case position, so it can always follow this A-movement

### DPs which don't need to satisfy the Case Filter

1. PRO
    - it wants to be in Spec of a NON-finite TP
2. Things that look like DPs but are not arguments
    - these function adverbially instead - motify verbs
    - plausibly analyzed as complements of a silent P

    > John left for Moscow last week

    > Sue does field work many places in Africa

3. DPs functioning as predicates
    - nonreferential and describing properties of other DPs

    > We elected Chris mayor

    > I consider that guy a stable geni

### Case for Wh-movement DPs

DPs which undergo Wh-movement still need to satisfy the Case Filter, which means they must first move to a Case position before moving up to Spec-CP

- includes DP null operators!
