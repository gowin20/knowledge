i love him!


how was bruin bridges in college?
interested to hear about your life in final year of college + after graduation


advice for how to lead a bunch of clubs, have a great time in college, and make sure my future is still good?

talk about myself


really enjoy art, but i'm a linguistics + computer science major

looking for ways to pursue both, and what i've found is Cobble
not sure how extensible Cobble is, i need to do more research on projects like it once I graduate



actually really need to handle money, and be realistic about that
make time for side things

be brutally honest with yourself about what the most important things to you are

make your family happy?
make the people around you happy?
connect a small group of people together really strongly?
work a six figure job and go on business trips twice a year? work in an office?
