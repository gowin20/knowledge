[[Juni Learning]]
Tan is an intelligent student who enjoys programming. He's very into Minecraft, and generally considers himself a gamer. He watches lots of minecraft youtubers (Technoblade, Dream, etc), which we enjoy talking about together. He also has quite a nice PC setup, with a large monitor and good peripherals

Once Tan understands a problem thoroughly, he's able to quickly apply his knowledge and solve it. However, he's still improving at critical thinking and problem analysis. He frequently asks if his ideas are correct before implementing them, and generally tends to wait for my guidance for most things. I've been pushing him towards independent problem solving, and he is improving at that. This has sometimes been a barrier to completing homework - make sure Tan thoroughly understands the ins and outs of the homework project and skills required!

A good instructor for Tan will:
- play minecraft
- push Tan towards working more independently
- thoroughly explain concepts and homework assignments, and make sure that he actually completes the homework
- progress through the course at a good pace

Finally, Tan's mother informed me that they were planning on pausing instruction with Juni around the end of May. Unless their plans change the new instructor will only teach Tan for a few sessions
