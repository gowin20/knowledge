One of my former students at [[Juni Learning]]. 

Top 2 students i've ever taught and it's not even close he's so fucking cool. I love him so much

# How to teach Krishna
Krishna is an incredibly smart and talented student. He's 11 years old and lives in New Jersey. Despite his young age, he speaks and codes at a very high level, better than any other student I've taught his age. He enjoys watching educational Youtube channels (CGP Gray etc), as well as Minecraft Youtubers like Technoblade. He also frequently codes in Python using VSCode in his free time, and has a passion for web design as well.  
  
A good instructor for Krishna will  
* Share some of his hobbies (Minecraft, Learning, History)  
* Challenge him to understand new concepts  
* Encourage him, as he frequently thinks that he's bad at programming (objectively wrong)  
* Help him stay on task, as he is very prone to distraction  
  
As far as class pacing, Krishna can be very domineering sometimes. He likes to "control the narrative" and has something to say right away every time I join Zoom. He talks a lot and gets curious a lot, and will end up googling a bunch of different stuff before you can even register that he's tabbed away. Make sure he stays on task!  
  
While he does get confused sometimes, Krishna is very smart and an excellent problem-solver. The biggest challenge to his learning is how frequently he gets distracted. It's all about channeling his energy in a productive direction, which works best when he's excited about what we're learning.  
  
Homework: I've found it productive to give Krishna a good amount of detail on homework assignments. He tends to give up if he's stuck, and generally has trouble with perseverance when I'm not there as he's so prone to distraction. He does the best work when he knows exactly what he needs to do, but it's still an interesting challenge.
  
Final tip: His little sister TRISHA is 6 years old and will frequently invade class. She will not leave on her own (and will only refer to me as "old man"), so ask Krishna to get his mother to remove Trisha from the room.

# Krishna Appreciation

Krishna is one of my favorite students, so here's some more Krishna appreciation. Keep in mind that he just turned 11!  
  
* Him and his friend in the grade above him coded a working chat site with numerous channels using NodeJS. I was able to join and talk to him on it!  
  
* One time his computer broke the morning we were supposed to have class, so he configured a Raspberry Pi with Zoom and was able to join class that way (sadly he couldn't use Mu on it so we had to reschedule anyways)  
  
* Recently he wanted to make a quiz using Python input for homework, and I let him because he was excited. He ended up making a big quiz all about ME, with questions about where I go to school and what I do for fun  
  
* Every class we've taught (though less recently) has had a theme - this idea was proposed by Krishna and he's picked out most of them himself. Themes have ranged from "William the Conqueror's invasion of Britain" to "Baked Potatoes" to "two old men fighting" ("because that's what the election is"). He'll name all of his variables after the theme and leave thematic comments  
  
Anyways, he's great. I'm certainly going to miss talking to him :(
