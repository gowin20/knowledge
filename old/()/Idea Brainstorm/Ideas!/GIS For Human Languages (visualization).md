# "GIS" For Human Languages (visualization)

Type: tech

# Basic Technical Background

- We want to look at the relationships between words in a language
- Pick a corpus of words (possibly all of english, possibly only a few hundred) and analyze a TON of data as to how they're used in sentences
- based on how frequently words are used together, we give their association a "weight". this represents how closely the words are associated
- use a graphic software in order to "map" words onto the screen
    - words that have a closer association are drawn more closely together - maybe with a visual indicator "connecting" them
    - would probably need only a subset of words or an association requirement, but it'd be cool to do everything

# Cool Research Applications

- If you chose the same subset of words across lots of different languages, you would definitely see interesting results
- This would allow you to more objectively compare and contrast associations and cultural influence across languages
- would probably also reveal a whole lot of similarities across languages which would allow people to better communicate
