honestly, I like them both.

Pros of obsidian:
- amazing graph view
- offline mode
- more lightweight
- i feel more inspired to write in it
- github green squares

Pros of Notion:
- extremely portable
- powerful database and template options
- use on my phone
- automatically sync across my laptop and desktop
- don't have to switch between preview + edit modes, WYSIWYG


right now I definitely like obsidian better and want to keep using it. Let's just assume that i'll be using both for the considerable future.

Use whichever one sparks more joy in the moment, whichever one I like more


My system should then accomodate several issues:

- converting from Notion markdown to Obsidian markdown
- converting from Obsidian markdown to Notion markdown
- downloading directly to vault
- uploading directly to notion
- synchronized across laptop + desktop
- synchronized notion and obsidian content



Assuming there's a way to automatically upload a folder of content to Notion:
- have a new folder under "my desk" on notion which contains all of my obsidian stuff




for knowledge:

really torn between notion and obsidian for this

- notion allows sharing with others
- obsidian allows an amazing graph view


my solution: sanitize existing notes by converting to obsidian
once working mirror exists on obsidian, upload back to notion
however, new notes are then created in notion



it looks like it's easier to CREATE NEW NOTES IN OBSIDIAN, then LET NOTES FIND A HOME ON THE NOTION

**for knowledge, notion will simply be a storage space for my notes. obsidian is where they'll be written**

**for journaling / myself / misc stuff, there's no restrictions. write wherever I want to, and create a system which enables me to do so**
