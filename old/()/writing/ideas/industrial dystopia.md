[[ROOFTOP STALKER]]
# ASCENT

goal: get as high as possible

locations:
- CNSI
- Young Hall, roof of boelter for rooftop shots


goal:

capture the essence of loneliness in a dystopian world

even if you make it to the top, there's nothing for you there

man lives in the grunge, below

decides to go up one day

breaks in, finds nothing but rejection

everything about society is constructed to be EXCLUSIVE

clothes: white, must be clean to fit in
language: must use proper words to fit in
education: high
