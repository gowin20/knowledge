gentle guiding points which help in my life, such as:
year of joy
year of order
quarter of novelty
season of compassion
week of sleep



I think it would be productive for me to define some themes for the coming QUARTER. Beyond that, this page can be a place for me to put all of my themes, as a theme history. Themes can even be as short as a week or maybe a day, we'll see what works for me.

# Active Themes

[[Year of Compassion]]
[[Quarter of Contact]]
