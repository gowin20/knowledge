Until tonight, I've been thinking about Notion and Obsidian as two sides of the same coin. However, I see now that the two are qualatatively different. Rather than trying to figure out which platform is superior, I should instead focus on [[using each according to its stengths]]

- I'll use Notion as a productivity and planning app
- I'll use Obsidian as a repository for all of my actual KNOWLEDGE.


I'm already starting to realize the potential of Notion as a productivity app in my life. I use it effectively for to-do lists, which I like because the app works [[across multiple devices]]. I'll continue to use it
- to plan my day
- plan ahead
- keep track of what I have to do in my life in general
- to do collaborative things


however, I'll start to move my KNOWLEDGE BASE to obsidian. every time I take miscellaneous notes on Notion, it always feels like they're in the wrong place. Specifically, like I'm writing something down that i'll never look at again
