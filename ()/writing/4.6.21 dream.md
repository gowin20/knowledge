I was at a cabin again
isolated, in the middle of nowhere / with a long straight rod leading to it


crazy horror dream
possible serial killer on the loose with name like
saag nogla
it was nicholas
map of origin of serial killer's name places them as from tennessee
spend a little bit worried about them. we're like the victims
it was me and my wife (not eshreya, didn't really ever have a face)
we insisted on going to this cabin, the cabin where all the victims were killed
we figured out that that's where hte killer probably was,
as detectives we wnt to go stop him
wife got like mortally wounded / poisoned
the only antidoe was in this cabin place, where all the victims are killed
of course my wife dies
rip, pretty sad
brutal horror scene is what follows!
waves and waves of viscera and gore
mixed with brown shit - possibly literally shit, but as viscous as blood
dead bodies exploding
a dog's body having tons of this stuff running out of it
tons of human bodies doing the same
started from the cabin and propogated outwards
absolutely brutal


cut to:
normal (but stressful) life, i'm staying at a cabin with my family (same cabin)
there's no service upstairs so i'm cut off
spend a while messing with the wifi router
figure out a solution but for some reason it's not good, end up unplugging the router
ask for my dad's help
"DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD"
he comes upstairs but i remember to plug in the router before he comes
and then it's like fine i think
worried that being away from phone w/ no service will result in lots of missed messages
as i go to see, i wake up
