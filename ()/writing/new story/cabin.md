the cabin lies at the end of a long, perfectly straight road. It's surrounded by nothing, a shimmering expanse of nothing that goes on for an undefined distance. The road, likewise, stretches to infinity like a line on a graph. This place is not of earth.

The cabin itself appears fairly normal, as far as weird cabins go. It's got two stories, with a small porch in the front and a round window on the second floor above the porch. The sides of this cabin are composed of horizontal slats of wood, with thick umber logs anchoring at the corners. other windows might be present on the cabin as well.

heading into the cabin, you find 

a scrappy team of resistance fighters
a coven of demon sisters dedicated to hunting men
a family on vacation

all have equal potential to inhabit the cabin


the resistance fighters are hiding out in the cabin as a last resort. the force knows where they are seemingly constantly, so they've been forced to flee here to the edges of reality. There's nothing out here, but that should prevent the demons from finding them. Hopefully. 

Unless they live here in the first place!

the demon sisters are scary as fuck honestly. Twisted asymmetrical horns rise from heads of perfect hair, black fading to purple fading to blue. full figures disguise twisted, snarling faces fully aware that the action which brings them the most joy is inflicting torment on others. These people exist to cause pain and suffering in the world, and revel in every second of it.

There are three of them. One, ancient and extremely wise. One, newer but like an older sister. One, just converted from a human and forced to hunt her love.


I'm not tied to this story at all, I'm just thinking about this cabin. There's so many other places out there
