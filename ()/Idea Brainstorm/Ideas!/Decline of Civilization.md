# Decline of Civilization?

Rate of decline of civilization

Exponentially increasing complexity is self destructive

Yikes

For like, intelligence and human knowledge

Think about Harry Potter spells

Matt says that Arvada kadabra ruins the point of dueling, so it shouldn't have ben in Harry Potter

But because of harry potters magic system it just has to be

So it's like, why wouldnt everyone just use that one spell

Experimentation is discouraged 

Given enough time, will this result in magic decreasing in complexity or even ceasing to exist?

Is this logic applicable to more than harry Poter?
