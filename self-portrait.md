I'm excited to paint a stunning portrait of myself.

I want to do one as realistic as possible to start

I could also do variations, including:

me in different states of life
watercolor
pixelated
stained glass


I need to decide my prototype image

me with:

- shortish hair
- great jawline
- powerful
- confident expression
- eyes that convey
	- confidence
	- power
	- willingness to take
	- genuine caring
	- deep understanding and empathy
