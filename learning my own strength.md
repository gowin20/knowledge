when I was in first grade, I had a best friend named Audrey. He was absolutely amazing, and probably one of the more formative people in my early life. Not to mention that his name probably contributed to my looser understanding of the gender dichotomy.

Audrey was a very sweet person, and one of the only people that I got along with *really* well in first grade. We hung out all the time, and used to go to Tae Kwon Do together after school.

One day, Audrey and I were playing on the playground together. We were throwing rocks against a wall, like first graders do.

Audrey set his rocks down and went to pick something up. As he walked away, I decided to throw a rock at him.

I lobbed the rock I was holding, and it hit Audrey directly on top of his head. He dropped to the ground and didn't move.

I walked over to check on him, only to find blood coming out of his head

freaking out, I ran inside to find our tae kwon do instructor. I don't remember many specifics, other than crying over my friend's safety.

Audrey was okay, but I honestly don't remember all of the specifics. The event is so jumbled in my mind, since it was long ago. 

the events are so jumbled in my mind. Because of this, to this day I believe that the top of my head is the softest, weakest part of my skull. and I can actually feel this, if I run my hand along my skull - it's more sensitive than the rest


He didn't have brain damage, thank god. It was just a head injury. Still though, he was bleeding pretty badly because I threw a rock at him. At my best friend.

Why did I do this?
what the fuck, George?

- perhaps I have an unconcious desire to hurt the people closest to me

I think, though, that I simply didn't know my own strength. I was in first grade! How was I supposed to know that I could injure my friend like that? Hell, how was I supposed to know that I would hit him at all! I don't know if I was even aiming for him in the first place.

I don't think I understood until this very moment how easy it is to hurt other people. Humans are fragile, precariously balanced pieces of machinery who can be messed with in a thousand different ways, and on that day I found the most direct method.

Of course, I would learn how to hurt people emotionally later on

Most of all, on this day I learned how much I deeply, deeply dislike hurting other people. I still haven't forgiven myself for hurting my best friend - and our relationship was never, ever the same after I threw that rock.





for a long time, I've thought that my strength is a bad thing. I'm so capable of hurting others, and it's so easy for me, so that means that I'm fundamentally bad. at the very least, it means that I need to shut myself off from the rest of humanity.

now though, I'm realizing that that isn't necessarily true.

Despite all the times that I've hurt other people, I'm realizing that in many cases I have helped them just as much. by focusing a majority of thoughts on the bad cases rather than good, I've internalized this view of myself as a harmful bad person. 

I help people just as much!!!

I contribute to everything I"m a part of, I help all of my friends all the time, I genuinely care aboutfgv all of the people in my life


Most recently, I saved the life of my friend Blackjet. Samantha Choi.

She's a great person, and told me straight up that I saved her life by averting her suicide. I did that deliberately, because I cared about her.

I think this is the reason I felt so uncomfortable when she told me I had saved her life. It conflicted with my view of myself as a bad person, someone not capable of doing something that good.

I am a good person. I help other people. I have strengh, but as long as I channel it in proper ways, I won't hurt anyone. Let's get it boys! I"M FUCKING AMAZING LETS GOOO YAYYYYY FUCK YES I"M FUCKING INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE MYSELF!
