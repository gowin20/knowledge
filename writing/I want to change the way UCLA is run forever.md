I'm fucking sick of it man

This is the worst trip of my life, or at least close to it. Just about the worst timing I could've possibly asked for. Being away from UCLA in this critical moment has led to some disasters in my life, including
- [ ] my relationship with Shreya almost falling apart
- [ ] not being present for cobble (honestly, not that bad)
- [ ] feeling overwhelmed with depression and anxiety and sliding backwards into becoming a bad person
- [ ] losing the UCLA game?

overall though, I've worked my butt off from a distance and have done an okay job of mitigating catastrophe. I'm still dating Shreya, which is a HUGE relief. I was so worried, and over the last several days have even wanted to break up with her myself
Enigma has still had lots of Airship runs, which is great. I'm not certain the tournament will end up firing, though, and I don't want to force it. Need to focus on going with the flow and doing what feels natural for the club. It's already in a pretty okay place to go back to in-person

I managed to get lots of work done on the UPE discord server. I'm a lot closer to Vivek, and I really like him

I'm speaking at an honors panel soon, and that's great. Even though I missed a leadership meeting, my expressed interest and friendship with margaret still got me in the door

It looks like cobble is kinda fucked for the startup accelerator


i have serious concerns that the current administrative board of cobble is right for the job. I think the problems are
- jawan is not fit for a position involving responsibility
- carson is not invested in cobble
- oliver is extremely unreliable and inconsistent in his work and communication
- shreya is great and perfect for her role on the team

It's my job as leader to mitigate these problems as much as possible. It's less about putting myself in a position of power, and more about maximizing cobble's effort
In an effort to do this, I should
- remove almost all responsibility from jawan (with shares accordingly)
- find a position that's right for carson, and make sure he does what he's best at and most motivated to do
- make sure oliver is never the only person necessary to do something
- give more responsibility and managerial operations to Shreya

I need to
- codify and SIMPLIFY our team documents
- ask shreya to revamp our notion with me
- simplify simplify simplify
- create a schedule of weekly meetings
- create a weekly goals sheet
- delegate tasks to each team effectively, they can figure it out within themselves
- talk to everyone more
- talk to each team member 1 on 1 and get where they're at
- find more programmers
- find a head marketing person
- find marketers and influencers

whatever. Cobble is going well, but I clearly have a lot of work to do on it still. Cobble is one of the main sources of my power going into my fourth year

I want to build a network of power to affect positive change at UCLA, and to advance my own career

I need to make sure that whatever I do leads into a very sucessful life after college. My life doesn't end here, it's just going to be a highlight

In the worst of my days, I plan for the best.
In the best of my days, I enjoy myself to prepare for the worst


I'm currently building a network of power and influence at UCLA. I'm already well connected, and once I move into a few more inner circles I'll be one of the best connected undergraduates at the entire university. I have influence and power and clout, so I need to figure out what I'm going to do with it

- how to get and maintain power
- what I want to do with it


I want to establish a revolutionary new sect of people at UCLA. I want to establish a new type of organization, blurring the line between club, startup, fraternity, and friend group.

This is what the school needs right now, and I'm in the perfect position to do it. I need to make it official and get it passed through UCLA legislation. I need it to appeal to everyone, be interdisciplinary, and have official support from many different organizations at UCLA.

These organizations will appeal to people who create, rather than destroy. Givers, rather than takers.
People who create in tech, create in art, create in social groups, create in orgs, on campus, through art, through activism, through careers. There's a stark difference between people like that, true builders, and people who only live for pleasure. This doesn't mean that you don't think about yourself. Rather, you think about yourself in a way that betters the community around you.
There's a difference between
- pleasing yourself by finding your true passions and growing as a person
- pleasing yourself by drinking all day, or by playing video games all day

I'm making an organization for people who know who they are, who have found themselves and want to show others. It's also going to be for people who want to find themselves - people with the same mentality, but who aren't as far along on the journey.

This is seriously important, the most important thing I can do with my life

These organizations should exist beyond school and could directly result in people advancing the rest of their lives in incredible fashion.

I want to start a "life accelerator". A "world accelerator".
People establsish and progress their own lives by bettering themselves, and everyone else in the process


weed is okay in groups but not to be abused. Use as a reward and during times of relaxation
parties are encouraged, but once again as a reward not expectation
sexual exploration could even be encouraged

a close-knit community, establishing a culture of everyone lifting up the people around them as much as possible. Take traditional "job competition" out of the picture


these are all just ideas for right now. The core of this idea is productives coming together in community and lifting each other up. I need to write a concrete manifesto about this detailing why I feel this is necessary, and specifying exactly what I envision with this.


Once fleshed out, I can start to use my influence at UCLA (this quarter!!!) to officially establish this on campus.

Cobble could then be the first of these communities in the eyes of UCLA. It defies traditional club/startup boundaries, aims to establish a culture and community on campus, and is exactly what the world needs right now.

Get official status through UCLA beaurocracy, on the same level as the BOARD OF FRATERNITIES. GET THIS SHIT RECOGNIZED!

Then, get a house for next year

Start with margaret. I need to talk to her and get connected through her

find another entity like cobble who could become the second founding member
find more from there, but eventually establish that ANYONE WHO WANTS TO CREATE THESE CAN GIVEN A DUE PROCESS

find a few more entities. Honestly, we need at least 4 or 5 to be taken seriously

that means that i'm going to be using my connections to:
- get official recognition by UCLA
- find other entities like mine and establish alliances
- find like-minded people and encourage them to establish more
- get as many people talking about my as i possibly can



Current organizations which I am influential in, ranked in order of influence:

- Enigma
- Cobble
- UPE
- College Scholars Program


wow that's depressingly small. In addition to official organizations, I also know some influential people pretty well:

- Ethan, Divesh, Krishy
- Tate (graduating)
- Margaret (graduating)
- Anthony (graduating)
- Daniel
- Shreya
- Carson
- Oliver


And there's way way way more people who I know well enough to network with. Art people, UPE people, pretty much any miscellaneous person I've met in my time at UCLA



it seems like I need to

1. establish myself and my culture as a force on UCLA campus. become very cool and get lots of people joining
2. become so sensationial that we gain the attention of UCLA
3. become so large that UCLA is not able to shut us down
4. connect with UCLA and get official school approval, integrate my ogranization as an official part of the UCLA ecosystem by the time I graduate



right now let's just focus on step one. I'll need
1. a statment of purpose, manifesto, a concrete foundation on which to build and use to explain and recruit others
2. concrete reasons to join, benefits to joining
3. concrete things that we do
4. a house?



create a house of excitement and production

:smile:

would it have to be exclusive? I think it should self-select for the right kind of person. However, we need safeguards regardless
it has to be desirable
which means it has to have a barrier to entry

you have to be actively creating  to be able to join
and you have to continue creating actively to stay in it

creating ANYTHING. it doesn't need to be the same thing every time either
