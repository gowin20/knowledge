figure my shit out dude!
I've got a meeting in half an hour, then meetings for pretty much the rest of the day afterwards. I've gotta engage my brain in fields related to

- enigma
- cobble
- honors
- UPE

so literally all FOUR of my major commitments haha

I don't want to put expectations too high for myself in terms of other things. After these meetings, I'll be sober and write or game or whatever strikes my fancy. I'm feeling a day of writing honestly. I've spent SO much time this morning working on my obsidian knowledgebase and graph. It's starting to look way better! However, I'm also starting to get kinda tired of it lol
