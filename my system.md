currently, this means "my journal and todo lists". I've been doing that a LOT - approaching a year - and I've definitely learned what works for me and what doesn't

works:
+ writing down tasks for the day
+ writing down tasks i need to do in the week (brain dump)
+ having a space to write anything if needed


doesn't work:
- lots of overhead to adding / changing tasks
- tasks not done in the day tend to get left behind
- list of tasks doesn't effectively map to times in the day


Let's focus on that last one. Let's figure out a way to efficiently and effectively map a list of tasks to a day.

One solution is to divide the day into static blocks, then assign tasks to each block. This is like the schedules used in high school - it works, but I find it clunky. It doesn't take into account the varying durations of tasks, and it certainly doesn't take into account varying degrees of motivation or spontaneity

It seems like there's not an effective way to perfectly map out my day WHILE STILL MAINTAINING SPONTANEITY

Instead of viewing my todo list as "a picture of what my day will look like", let's view it instead as "a possible direction my day can move in"

that way, I won't get upset when things inevitably change as they ALWAYS do.

The list is a REFERENCE GUIDE FOR MY DECISION TREE THROUGHOUT THE DAY. If I'm not sure what to do in a situation, I need to reference my guide in order to check and make sure I'm doing the right thing.

view the day as a decision tree, and my todo lists as a little helper fairy to guide me along the path.

I should start viewing these guides as MUCH MORE ESCOTERIC. I"LL MAKE THEM FOR EACH DAY, AND THE GOAL WILL BE TO ENCAPSULATE THE VIBE OF EACH DAY. I"LL STILL NEED A COMPONENT OF TODO BUT THAT"S ONLY PART OF WHAT THE GOAL IS. EACH DAY SHOULD HAVE A VIBE EVEN IF THE VIBE IS SAD AND DEPRESSING. ESPECIALLY THEN< SO THAT I CAN GUIDE MYSELF TOWARDS SELF CARE. THIS IS GOOD
