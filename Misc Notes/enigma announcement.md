# enigma announcement

Hey guys! This server has changed a lot over the past couple weeks, so I thought I would send out a ping to let everyone know what's going on. I'm George Owen, the new Vice President of Enigma at UCLA. As it is still not possible for us to conduct meetings in person, my fellow officers and I have decided to use this discord as the **official meeting place for Enigma at UCLA**. As part of this revamp, we've changed around a lot of channels, so let an officer know if anything seems to be missing here (personally I think we should add a memes channel).

Additionally, the server now has **ROLES**! Head over to #roles and click the appropriate emoji reactions in order to give yourself roles on this server. We'll be using these roles to let people know when we're running games and holding meetings

Finally, some more time-sensitive stuff:

**Summer Enigma's second meeting is tonight, from 6-9pm PDT** (so, about an hour from now). We're going to be running **deception games**, with plans to play Avalon, Secret Hitler, and Coup, among others. There's a million deception games out there so we can really play any that you guys want to. We were so pleased with how last week's event turned out - I can't wait to see everyone again tonight!
