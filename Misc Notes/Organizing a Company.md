# Spotify Takeaways

Scrum: an agile development approach

Agile Principles >> Scrum, Practices

Key driving force: autonomy

Spotify Squad

- sit together
- end-to-end responsibility for the stuff they build
- long term mission
- each squad does whatever they want to solve the problem

automation is important for motivation. motivated people build better stuff

kind of like a jazz band (@matt)

loosely coupled, tightly aligned squads

Communicate what problem needs to be solved, and why

squads collaborate to figure out the best solution to the problem

informal approach to problem solving gives more flexibility

anyone can edit any code, culture of peer code review

Focus on motivation

Many levels of abstraction to create organization. Not hierarchical, focus on COMMUNITY

- Squad
- Tribe
- Chapter
- Guild
- etc

Make releases as EASY as possible!

Encourage small + frequent releases

invest in automation, continuous delivery

Release trains: serve weekly / biweekly release trains with new features / content. Hide unfinished features in the release, which exposes problems early!

Encourages frequent, good releases

Just toggle visibility
