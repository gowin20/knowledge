I dreamed that I was in the car with Josh. We spent a while driving around doing whatever, but eventually we had to head into a new area - i think it was Belle Meade. Josh had an appointment at the medical center there, and while I initially wanted to be dropped off elsewhere (food etc), I relented and decided to come with him. The Boys were there, evan and perhaps someone else.

The people were honestly amorphous - started as the boys, morphed into my SO (who I assume was Shreya in the dream but no faces), there was also this other guy there that was kind of a wildcard. He reminded me of Shawn Cee mixed with Skalla mixed with others

anywasy, we pull up to the medical center - turned on a road that's a mix of Dale Maebry and Belle Meade Boulevard - and it's like a fucking RESORT. The central plaza has an insane amount of crazy features like a YMCA - big pools, obscene amounts of tennis courts (in my head i'd practiced tennis there many times), as well as other stuff.

Map: the pool was in the top middle, directly above 8 tennis courts (very large pool). on all sides surrounded by medical buildings, except maybe the top. Lots of people (patients, people who just want to swim, etc) are vibind around here.
rotate this 90 degrees so the pool is on the left, tennis courts on right, and above them is most of the medical buildings. There are also medical buildings to the right of the tennis courts, and below them.

Keep going right and you'll arrive ar the road. Across the street from this place was a nice park, rather large. In my head, THIS part of the dream took place in Tampa Florida. I remember thinking that the entire ground was super flat,  so the park would be boring and flat.

as with all great institutions, there's a bunch of unnecessary rules. At this point this institution shifted to be more like a school to me - though maybe it was always supposed to represent a university

university -> country club and hospital

anyways, don't break the rules. Rumors have been going around about a special shop which provides all sorts of illegal bootleg stuff: christmas lights (which have been BANNED but are showing up everywhere now), help on homework and exams (CHEATING, FRAUD), etc. - all sorts of stuff. This shop seemed mythical, but I was determined to find it. 

I took Shreya and we started searching campus. 

there might have been a physical listing of different stores, with the bootleg one on it?

I found a map and figured out that it'd be most likely to crop up as a physical store somewhere on the far extremeties of campus. We set out north, cutting behind buildings and alwyas taking a weird nontraditional route. Eventually we came across these sheds with christmas lights on them. As we rounded the corner, the density of the christmas lights increased, snaking around the buildings and between them like otherworldly rosevines, their bulbous thorns blinking intermittently with light. It was strangely beautiful, and a confirmation that we're headed in the right direction. Checking the map, these sheds were located on a weird remote edge of the most remote building on campus - you couldn't find a more out-of-the-way spot if you were looking for it. We walked through the gap between building and shed, and emerged on the other side to find THE STORE!

and there she was in all her glory. Not just the store, but her. The eponymous figure of mystery and corruption on this campus, manning the desk of the store herself. Vibes of chessbae95, evil secretaries, and people who know more than you about what you're trying to uncover. People deeply involved, but also in positions of power over you. She was there, and we'd interacted with her before.

she's manning the counter at a store with rows upon rows of miscellaneous items. Boxes upon boxes of christmas lights, stacks and stacks of papers - which I assume represented academic dishonesty, and other things which I didn't fully register, as I was focused on her.

Before me or shreya could say anything, the other guy stepped forward. had a conversation like did you commit fraud, yes or no


ok now i'm very nervous about pee so i need to go see what's going on with shreya
