[[5.27.21]]

I'm on a plane back to nashville right now. My nose really itches, there's babies behind and around me, and I'm no longer very high. Well, I wasn't that high to begin with in fairness, at least not after the uber ride. I made a bunch of progress on my personal website, including outlining what I actually want to be on it and laying the super basic html. Eleventy is neat as well, I'm looking forward to using that. I've still got to really make it look pretty, and do a bunch of art related to it. That will be a good project to finish by the end of finals week at UCLA.

for the next few weeks, I'll be
- seeing my family
- visiting with friends
- partying
- rekindling connections
- ramping up real publicity for cobble
- creating my personal website
- trying to write evry day

I feel like some basic journalism will help me retain conciousness.

Now, there's something that I've been pondering a lot in the last 24 hours, as well as on and off for a considerable amount of time now. I think that I need to stop smoking weed for the entirety of my senior year of college. At minimum, I can never smoke alone and I can never suggest to others that weed be smoked. If people request to smoke with me, I'm not quite sure what my policy will be.

The problem with weed is that it makes me complacent. Not being sober reduces my capacity for life, including planning and having fun as well as connecting and creating genuinely great work. Sobriety is the clear path forward, as well as the only path which carries with it very little stress. I won't need to worry about drug tests, or anything else.

In my mind, this sobriety starts at the beginning of Fall Quarter. Summer can be a transition phase where I smoke less and less.

I should make my best effort to be completely sober for the entirety of senior year!
Obviously, all of this goes for alcohol as well. Alcohol, however, is generally a more social drug - I expect that I'll be drinking some of it at parties etc, which I *might* also do for weed. I'm genuinely less sure about that. I will not hit nicotine a single time my senior year, over the summer, or in nashville at any point. that shit just isn't worth it, no exceptions makes it easier to hold strong.

No exceptions makes it easier to hold strong. That's the problem. because the tradeoff with that is that I'm conciously sacrificing a large amount of potential "ins" - how important is knowing those people? Do I need to be high to know them, or will my extensive knowledge of smoking culture be enough? I feel like I've got this figured out already for nicotine, and can apply a very similar logic.

The only problem with all of this is that I really like being high. Once in a while, it can be a fun refreshing way to destress, not to mention all the anxiety relief it provides me.

Potential metric:
- I may not own any weed
- I may not smoke weed in my house
- I may only smoke weed recreationally with friends, and may only do so 3 times per quarter.
- Special exceptions may be made permitting for social situations, provided there is a genuine end goal which will further my career and life.


Even this seems needlessly complicated. It might be better to completely cut drugs out of my life, with no exceptions. This definitely feels like a crossroad, and I'm searching for an effective compromise that lets me get the best of both worlds.

talk to daniel about this! How does he feel, I wonder?

I'll revisit this soon.
