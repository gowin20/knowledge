Resolution: Refers to the level of granularity of a map

# Cartographic Scale

A specific distance on the map represents a proportional distance on the earth

We use a **representative fraction** to represent this
- Unit-less, simply a ratio
- use **Map Distance : Earth Distance**
- $\color{aqua}1 : 100,000$

We also use **word scale** to specify this in units

- 1 cm to 1 km
- be careful with this type of scale when resizing maps

A **Scale Bar** conveys an accurate representation of scale even when reproduced in different formats

- scales to the current map size. Includes units on earth

### Larger Scale is ZOOMED IN
- Shows less area, in greater detail

**Larger Scale == Greater Detail**
- everything on the map appears larger
- the fraction 1/10,000,000 is a LARGER DECIMAL
- Greater scale generally means greater resolution

- 0.0000001

### Smaller Scale is ZOOMED OUT

- everything on the map appears smaller
- So called because the fraction 1/50,000,000 is A SMALLER DECIMAL
- Smaller scale generally means smaller resolution
