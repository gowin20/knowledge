I had a crazy dream about the apocalypse starting at UCLA

it started as the result of titans

I was the attack titan, possibl the founding titan as well. There was a BIG enemy, and we showed down in this massive field. I had lots of titans (reminiscent of Ohms), and the enemy was a large, mostly stationary titan / thing. I remember deciding to ignore the fight, and instead trying to escape and get out

I think that the other person I was fighting then gave the ability to bring about the end of the world 0 perhaps i caused the apocalypse then

well I left

and took someone with me, this hardass catholic girl who seemed to like me. We held hands while running away

I got back to UCLA with her, and the world was starting to end

the main concern is that the water levels were rising. We were at the beach (which was right next to Dykstra/dorms, where we all lived - except insisde it was like actual apartments)

as we stood on the beach, the water level started to rise. It would recede a little bit, then come up further. I remember being on the beach, and being in the process of going to kiss this girl, who was super down. the water level rose to our feet, then receded much further. we fucking ran. Oliver was there too i think

the water level kept going WAY out
then, by the time we made it off the beach, it came BACK to cover pretty much the entire beach. the waves would only get much, much larger

we made it up the hill from the beach, and the waves kept following. as we walked up the next hill into dykstra, the waves made it up the hill and covered the road. I remember a chartruse truck with SHARK FINS on it, sitting in the road. It got inundated with water, luckily not moved too much by this one

it seems like the waves were getting taller. It reminded me of Ponyo, the large arcing waves coming to crash into the shore.

we made it back into the dorms, and I immediatley went to find daniel and shreya. fuck that other girl i was with, shreya is infinitely better ( i remember thinking that in the dream )

we all decided to PACK as fast as we could and then get out. I ended up spending a good amount of time packing, don't know how long it actually was but obviously i was trying to go as fast as I can

wow i felt the "Dream inertia" here as well. trying to do something and feeling that sense of inertia which ONLY happens in dreams. I remember thinking about that, thinking aboust timething like dreams, and moving on. That would be a great opportunity to recognize lucid dreams in the future.

I continued packing, starting with my backpack and random non-clothes shit. backpack full, I packed duffle bag next

the layout of this place: I had a room with a big (at least double) bed in it, with a dresser on the opposing wall of the bed and my backpack next to it. as you walk in, the bed is on the right wall, and there's a closet in the room with some amount of space. That's where I was keeping my suitcase / etc

all of my clothes were clean enough, but I still hadn't folded them ( as I haven't in real live still ). I ended up stuffing my entire laundry bag into the suitcase.

my original plan was to leave my clothes here and sequester them into a closet. Thinking was that the water might not destroy the house, in which case I can put everything in the closet and come back for it later
worries because there was a window in a weird place of the closet, might break
also considered stuffing the bottom of the door with a liner, like tissues (towel would work better now imo)

Daniel said that he was planning on stashing his stuff in obscure spots around campus, so he doesn't have to carry them all. I supplemented that our goal right now could be to go to Hedrick Summit, the highest point around here.

as we were finishing packing and almost ready to leave, my alarm went off and I woke up.

were we to strike out, I have no doubt that the waves would've been right upon us. The moment we walked back out into that nightmare, we would've been greeted with a massive, arcing wall of water ready to take our whole building down. I'm not sure how we would've survived, or what else the "end of the world" would entail. It certainly, in my mind, turned into a vivid dream about a flood. If it was the end of the world, it's pretty clear that I was going to die there. However, my actions in the dream led me to believe that maybe it wasn't actually! It could have been simply an apocalyptic flood, similar to tsunamis. The water recession is indicative of that. However, with a Tsunami it only happens once. Here, it happened over and over, bigger and scarier each time. the waves will only increase in size as the malicious agent moves the moon closer and closer to earth.

scary!
but I'll be okay. I was with my friends, and we were making a plan to survive. Not only could we try to survive, we also were figuring out a way to keep our stuff intact.
I think our obsession with materialism could easily have cost us our lives there. We spent so long packing meaningless possessions - though I remember packing this tie-dye purple,pink,and orange blanket that I took from someone because i wanted to be able to return it to them.

this time spent could have been spent finding a hiding spot
if the waves were really going to keep coming, then all of Los Angeles, California, even the world could become underwater. The idea of the waves continually getting bigger, and NEVER stopping, until i guess all of the water in the ocean is used up, is scary!
