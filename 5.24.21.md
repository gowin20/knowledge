[[5.26.21]]
it's been a while, and I kinda fell off of journaling here for the last week. I ended up moving my daily system back over to notion because mobile is too sexy. I'm still planning on writing here though.

today i've got therapy, so I'll need to brainstorm what [[stuff to talk about]]

i've also got enigma event tonight, in-person! it might end up going late

i've got an interview as well, directly after therapy. need to stay on my email shit as well, and call ethan
