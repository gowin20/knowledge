Hear me out, sounds kinda weird but a savory pancake is now my go to
pancake. Put in the batter shredded cheese onion and melted butter.

Tastes more like a stuffed yorkshire pudding but is sooooo delicious.

Don't put syrup on it just a bit of butter and salt and pepper.

Adult Pancakes (savory deliciousness)

- 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
- 3 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 1/4 cups milk
- 1 egg
- 3 tbsp melted butter
- Handful of chopped green onions or leeks
- Handful of grated cheese

Mix it all together and cook it like you would regular pancakes. Might have to flip them a couple times as they're a bit thicker

On top, just use a bit of butter and salt and pepper.

Bon-apple-teeth!
