## Who am I?

i'm interested in learning how to better express myself. I'm pretty creatively inclined, and have experience in visual arts and some acting and filmmaking. 

I have some experience "monologing" as a computer science instructor

I also write all the time, and I currently write for a Computer Science blog

i'm interested in learning how to express myself in this class, not just for acting and theater, but for all aspects of my life, even my career

# What do i want to write about?

- the day my parents told me about their history with drugs
- how people change
- coronavirus and bringing people together
- i like connecting people, so talk about the best way to connect with people
- i was a dick in high school
- interdisciplinary rage!

entropy

it's our differences, our chaos, that make us unique

but that very chaos is also what prevents us from connecting with each other

find patterns that are shared between you and the other person, and connect them. Relate to them on that basis

I want to write a talk on the best ways to connect with people

- the problem is my naievete. I don't know if what i'm saying is correct, or even any good at all. I want to avoid looking like a priveleged white person, which is essentially what it is
- my personal experiences meeting strange people in life
- the most diverse people i've spoken to

don't get attached to this! just start talking

see what life lessons i can derive from my own life

start by talking about my own personal experiences in life

epiphanies in my life

- Senior year of high school, when i found out that both of my parents were recovering alcoholics and addicts

Pivotal Moments in my life

Low moments in my life

humanizing hard data in my life

something funny! and simultaneously motivating / inspirational

something to inspire the people around me to be creative, and do more

something to be 

people care about laughing. swing your speech towards laughter and emotion in general
