# three types of languages

1. imperative 
    - assignment
    - iteration
    - order of statements is critical, since variable values change over time
    - ex: C
2. functional languages
    - recursion
    - single value variables
    - recursion = iteration, in functional languages
    - ex: ML, Lisp
3. logic programming languges
    - expressing a program through logical inferences
    - ex: Prolog
4. object oriented
    - uses objects, in addition to being imperative
    - keeps large programs organized
    - ex: Java

- many modern languages try to combine some of these
- so it's not always easy to categorize languages into these 4 categories
- lots of controversy around which language is the best, what exactly these terms mean
- programming languages evolve and change, just like natural languages
