# OCaml

Memory Management: - built in GC
Other Notable Features: - grammars, parse trees
- type inference like in python
- multiple inheritance â†’ classes can inherit from multiple classes
- pattern matching
- [head::tail]
- currying functions
- tail recursion
- functional languages good for writing interpreters
Type Checking: compile time checking with type inference (types determined at compile time like in java, but it infers types like in python)
Type of Language: ML w OO features
functional programming as a whole: 
- recursion used for iteration, while in OO, iteration are loops
- attempts to avoid mutable data, eliminating side effects
- w the same parameters, the output of a function should be the same every time
- thrives where state is not a factor
- data is only transformed through functions, not put in objects
