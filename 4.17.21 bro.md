hauhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

I feel particuraly tired and lethargic right now. I didn't sleep very well last night, and though I've felt like this day has contained lots of potential energy, right now it's hard to realize that.

Potential that's been realized today:
- ACM x UPE collab through discord (i would help mediate)
- Cobble coding looks okay
- UPE social went okay
- feelings of increasing power and centralization and importance at UCLA



even right now I'm beginning to worry that I've taken on too much for myself next year.

My priorities for [[fourth year]] are:
1. accrue as much power, influence, and connections as possible at UCLA
2. position myself for a super sucessful life out of college
3. have a shitload of fun

in my mind, (1) will go a long way towards making (2) a reality. It can also help with (3) though much less so.

Even still, I need to focus on (2) more - actively positioning myself for a super amazing life outside of college means that I'll need to be doing a lot for myself
- actively networking in order to seek out the best job opportunities
- presenting myself as impressively as possible
- making impressions and keeping in contact with the people I meet and connect with

additionally, even though (1) is my top priority I need to be careful not to go overboard. If I insert myself as essential figures in too many places, I certainly will be spread too thinly and all will suffer as a result (think sophomore tate).

so I need to think about **which positions are the most important towards my power and influence in life.** Then I can balance that with my biggest passions as well.

Obviously
1. Cobble

If all goes well cobble will form the foundation of my entire fourth year. As the team gets further up and running, over the fall I hope to shift to a bigger-picture "coordinator executive" role, which will still require SO MUCH WORK.

2. UPE

UPE does seem super important. The connections and job opportunities in TECH SPECIFICALLY cannot be understated. Definitely important!

3. College Scholars

I want to be involved with this while also keeping it as minimal a time commitment as possible. In my mind this is my best opportuinity to meet the most creative, important, freethinking people I can in college.


4. Enigma

I love Enigma! My personal favorite club, and probably where I'll make the most FRIENDS I WILL KEEP OUT OF COLLEGE. It's not as important for jobs and internships beyond college, though.

I strongly feel like I shouldn't add any more than these four things. If I do, they should be low amount of time spent

oh and i guess

5. Classes

Literally just get out with Magna Cum Laude. That's important, having good grades. Influence-wise matters much less than the others though, even Enigma. I don't want to be Max from Rushmore, but I do want to make sure I'm setting myself up for success.
