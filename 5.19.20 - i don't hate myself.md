### i hate myself

it's almost 3 in the morning and i'm so upset.

I just spent 2.5 hours playing Heroes of the Storm with my friends and we just kept losing. I'm not happy about this.

Even when we won it wasn't that fun. It was okay, but i honestly just wanted to die and go to bed. I'm so tired right now.

I feel like i was productive and hard working all day, and it wasn't enough. even if it was enough, which it kind of is, i'm just not happy.

## I thought that being productive would make me happy! But it doesn't!

I think I am only productively happy when it's something I really love to do. And even then, only the core of it is fun. Lots of times there's other work to get through that isn't very engggaging, but is just kind of there. I just want to be happy.

I want to be happy

I want to make a difference in the world



which one is more important? I feel like i just want **both** but idk if that is possible. I want to become affluent, create something which will contribute positively towards humanity and help people, and get married and have kids with the girl of my dreams. I want this so badly! All of these things!


i don't think i hate myself. I think i'm just sad. i'm pretty upset and i just wanna feel genuine and satisfied with myself and the people around me. Maybe writing about my feelings is a good way to start doing that.

I don't hate myself. I'm just tired. i can go to bed now knowing that i'm going to be okay.
