Node.js is a backend programming language based on Javascript that runs server-side. Its primary advantage over other backend languages is its ability to quickly process a high throughput of async Input/Output operations. It does this via multithreading, but importantly all Node.js Javascript code actually runs on a single thread.

This is due to the architecture of Node.js, which can be summarized in three main components. Remember, this all lives on the back-end server that the clients send requests to. When the server receives a request from the client, that request is initially stored in the Event Queue - the first component. After waiting for its turn here, the request is sent to the Event Loop to be processed. The event loop is the single threaad I referred to previously that runs all javascript code. To properly process the request, the event loop delegates processing to the final major component, the Thread Pool. This thread pool represents the multithreading capabilities of Node.js, and process the request asynchronously. While they do so, the main Event Loop moves on to parse more requests. When the Thread Pool completes processing of the request, it returns all necessary information back to the Event Queue.
