I keep having these vivid visions of Zeus rolling around on the warm pavement of our driveway on a sunny day. Those few moments when we let him outside were the happiest of his entire life.

He used to spend so much time outside. I've never seen a happier cat. We'd call his name when the sun would start to set, and he'd come bounding out of the woods with his tail held high. There's this picture of him and ginger lazing on our driveway at our old house, amongst the leaves. They blend in and look so peaceful.

I really think their first 4 years were their most eventful and happiest. Olive was there to talk to, they had an entire world to explore, bushes to hide in, trees to climb, and all of the human family and attention they'd ever want. Then we moved, and most of that went away. They transitioned to indoor cats, and I don't know if they were ever the same afterwards. Zeus used to try to dart out the door in order to go outside. He did this for years, and only gave up recently. Instead he sits at the door while my dad is away, and waits for him to come back. My dad is Zeus' entire world. His favorite thing, best friend, faithful companion. I'm so happy that my dad was able to fill the void for Zeus. It took him a long time to get here, but I do think Zeus is happy now. He might never hit the same dopamine high as he has had before, but his life is good. Still, though, when I think of Zeus' glory days my heart sinks for him.

I feel so connected to my dad as well. Not just empathy, but genuine connection. I feel like if I listen hard enough, I can tap into his thoughts, feelings, and emotions. He surely feels as i do about Zeus. Maybe im wrong, and inserting myself into his position. I feel it though

Do I have an Oedipeus complex? Freud would say that everyone does to some extent. Part of me believes thats true. That myth is just an extreme extreme extreme version of evolutionary primal feelings. I'm not oedipeus and I don't have a desire to do any of that.

Its time to go eat pizookie. Talking about Zeus helped me calm down. I miss him so much. I miss ginger too :(

Can't wait to see them :(
