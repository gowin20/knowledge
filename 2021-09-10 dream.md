#dream 


I had a fucking amazing dream last night / mostly this morning

I was a sorcerer in a world with a magic system like nothing I'd ever seen before. Rather than learning spells and having wands, magic was cast through gestures with your body, and learned by practice like exercising muscles. Intuition was key, and the system allowed some truly fantastical stuff for those who mastered it.

There were two main types of spell I used all the time:

telekenisis: by looking at something, concentrating, and moving my eyes in a direction, I could move objects. This was difficult for me to control since I was just learning how to do it, but master sorcerers would be able to do basically anything with it. For me, I additionally used it both to fly and to basically have extremely low gravity and move in crazy ways. I felt like I had so much momentum and freedom as I was floating in the air, it was extremely magical. On top of that, i really felt genuinely free. I used it to explore the city around me, and when I got attacked in my home I, with my magic friends, leapt out of the window by my desk and Boing'd across the rooftops - we floated away in the coolest way possible! I could even change my direction midair because I was sick at telekenisis.

teleportation + resizing: By concentrating hard on a spot with intention, I could see what it would look like to be standing at that spot, basically far sight. By making an "ok hand" gesture and looking through the hole as I'm concentrating, I am able to teleport to the location I focus on!!! So fucking cool. Obviously there are some logistical difficulties such as what if you're laying down or there's not space, but like when in doubt nothing happens. At least, that's how it is for me right now. I'm still learning. This seems like an extremely, extremely powerful power though. On top of this, there's more. What I learned to do is resize myself or others by use of this power. By changing the diamater / size of the circle I made with my fingers, and concentrating, I could resize. Maybe it's because I'm passing through it, and it's like a scaling transformation hehe. I'm linear algebra man. and telekenisis is derivative man haha.
