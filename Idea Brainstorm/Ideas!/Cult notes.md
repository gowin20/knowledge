Core idea: event based memory

Event based ideas and thinking

Order thoughts spatially

Think in higher dimensions

You have a thought, which leads to another. This chain of thinking brings you to a conclusion. However, just as relevant as the conclusion is the train of thought which brought you there. Viewing your thinking process as a constituent and seeing each part of it in spatial relation to each other is essential.

In a way, this is how all thinking works. We never stop thinking. Our thoughts lead to more, in one massive chain that takes our entire life to complete

We store snippets of this thought process and experience as memories in our brain

All memory is very event based. We remember things temporally, as narratives. The nature of life requires us to view them this way. Time and language are spatially ordered, so the very nature of our consciousness is as well.

This manner of thinking is clearly how we exist in the universe. Our thinking, our experiences and memories, everything about us is viewed this way

Let's think about these objects and term them as a constituent - lines

The lines by which we experience reality

The line representing our passage through time

The line representing the path we take, in relation to other possible lines

This line has the power to look like anything you want it to look like. This line is you. This line is your entire life, fr

It seems like the only natural way to conceive of reality to me.

Pretty much everything is just lines to me. Even matter is all lines at Planck scales.

These lines are just lines drawn in higher dimensions. Rather than a line in any of the 3 spatial dimensions, lines of thought and experience are those in the upper three dimensions.

The three dimensions are

Time

Possibility

???????? Connection/Likelihood

I term these dimensions 4-6, and they represent the universe with much more information

They describe what can, will, and has happened in the lower 3 spatial dimensions in our universe.

Honestly, visualizing anything beyond the fifth dimension is quite difficult in my opinion, and though I have thought interestingly about the 6th dimension and have some notion of how one might imagine it, it eludes me for now

The sad truth is that it's impossible for human beings to truly understand and visualize anything beyond the third dimension. We have a fine understanding of time, but thinking about what we or other objects look like in the fourth dimension is quite difficult for us.

It's like, almost easier to think about the fourth and fifth dimension together. At least that's how I always think about it.

Time, the fourth dimension, is almost like the basis of an entirely new system. It dictates what happens in the spatial dimensions, but appears somewhat to them in the ways that we interpret it.

We're just so wrong as humans! lol

Time is most comparable to the first dimension. It's a new system, new coordinate plane (tracking the state of the first three dimensions). However, in the ways we conceptualize it it is completely linear. It's just a track of what's happened in your life, or the entire time history of an object.

Imagine a human in the fourth dimension. Wherever you move, whatever you do, it's all continuous actions. Your fourth dimensional self looks like a strange time snake, where if you looked at all moments where you've been in time it would be this strange fleshy tube snaking back and forth from your kitchen and everywhere else you've traveled.

A car would look quite strange too, and could have a larger scale than many objects (not humans, 

A desk would, on the other hand, remain relatively stationary its entire life. It would still have a track from where it was initially assembled, transported, and wherever it was subsequently moved or pushed. 

A desk is interesting as well because in the history you would totally see the components it is made of come into being. If you traced the desk backwards in history, it would disassemble itself, then all of its components would turn back into trees or go back into the earth. Keep tracing and those trees will shrink into back into saplings and then seeds, with the energy used to create the tree's mass turning back into sunlight, nutrients, and water. You could follow the entire lineage of trees back in history, until you get to the very first tree ever. Even the first tree arose from some other plant, probably some thick ass fern. I believe that if you keep going backwards, it's natrually all going to be a continuous chain. You could eventually lead back to the **very first seeds of life**. There might be more than one of these, but there's probably a relatively small amount of common ancestors that every living thing shares. Honestly, those common ancestors would then probably share a common ancestor as well, right? Well, I think it depends on the nature of reality and who created us. If we're in some sort of simulation, and a greater power completely beyond our comprehension exists - which I honestly believe myself - then it feels like we'll never know that kind of thing for sure.

I believe in God as far as I believe in the potential existence of a power out there so completely beyond our comprehension.

I feel strange saying this, but I think that the modern era has completely redefined the limits of humanity's collective imagination. The potential power that we may conceive of now, given our greater knowledge of the world, is exponentially greater than it was during the Roman Empire. That's when Christianity was invented - over 2,000 years ago. Civilization had to struggle to survive much more than it does now - we live on the backs of our ancestors.

People back then literally just don't have the knowledge that we do now. We know about the entire fucking UNIVERSE for god's sakes.

In fact, I think that one of the only things which has and always will remain constant in humanity is that we will never be able to truly ascertain why reality exists. At least, there's really no definitive way to know for sure. I totally believe that we can learn as much as we can about the nature of the world, but it's a completely different question to answer "why". Why do any of us exist - hell, why does *matter* exist at all? Why the universe? What's beyond the universe? It seems we may never know the answer to these questions. We as human beings are not capable of learning the answers, because we exist in the system we are trying to observe. Since our entire definition is what we're trying to understand, we can by definition not understand what is outside of it. It's literally outside of our scope.

Our universe could be like a temporary variable in some unfathomably complex computer program, and we would have no way of knowing. We're too tiny.

Literally like, the difference in level of scale could just be absolutely *enormous*. We could be inside of literal quarks, inside atoms which comprise a person or something of the like - something of similar scale

we could literally exist inside of a simulation as well! we could just be a complex computer program running on a 7 dimensional monitor! Literally that seems fucking *likely* to me to be honest.

My favorite observation out of all of this is that any theory you come up with is equally as likely as the next. We literally have *no way of knowing whatsoever*. 

It's just as likely that God exists in some form as it is that our entire universe exists as a quark in some 7-dimensional giant's toenails.

Two main beliefs I have right now:

- there are infinite dimensions, which are intertwined with the notion of scale and size. Starting at the first dimension - possibly in pairs of 3 like 1-3 (or like every prime amount), every larger dimension describes an exponentially infinite amount of the lower dimensions. 4-6 determine every possible configuration of the lower 1-3, across all periods of time. a complete description of our universe. 7-10 describe all possible configurations of 4-6, and so on
- we exist in an advanced simulation - perhaps one so advanced that the bullet point above is simply the way that its engine simulates everything. Our entire universe is fabricated, but it would still be genuine. It really exists how we preceive it, but "it" is just such a small subset of comprehensible things compared to everything that their actually is

I don't know any more, I'm kind of ranting. I need to go to bed!

My main takeaway from this is that human beings know so much more than we used to. We don't really have any new religions or systems of belief which accommodate our expanded knowledge. Even just in the last twenty years we've changed reality so fundamentally with our knowledge. And all we've got is fucking Scientology.

I'm honestly down with a lot of concepts in old religions, too. The only problem in my opinion is that every old god is based around knowledge which we have now superseded immensely. Or, in the case of religions like Catholicism, existed in part to help humanity continue to exist (don't use birth control so you can have more kids or whatever the fuck).

Fuck, maybe the entire concept of a singular god which definitely exists is outdated. I don't think we can ever prove if God exists, I think that's the point.

For me, that means we should focus on what we do have. What we do control.

We can understand ourselves, and see how we preceive everything in the universe. We can use those tools to our advantage, and manifest exactly what we want

we can control our own lives extremely well! even just by who we choose to associate with

We are powerful. let's take control of our lives and seek out exactly what we want.
