questions about Solar Constant on the exam
#### Solar Constant: measures the intensity of the sun
1800s, we already knew the ballpark estimate of what the solar constant was
it is: 
**1.3608 +- 0.0005 kW/m^2**
aka **1360.8 +- 0.0005 W/m^2**
Surprisingly constant throughout the earth
due to climate change, expect this number to increase by, 
at wost: 8.5 W/m^2
at best: 2.5 W/m^2

This is measured for a surface perpendicular to the solar beam. Unless the sun is directly overhead, this number will actually be smaller

Equinox: Spring / Fall


### Seasonal Insolation
**Insolation:** the amount of downward solar radiation energy on a plane surface
