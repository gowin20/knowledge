I have a special relationship with George. Beyond the fact that we share the same name, he is undoubtedly the most proficient student that I've ever taught. He's incredibly smart, possesses exceptional problem-solving skills, and has a large amount of patience and persistence which enables him to accomplish almost anything.

He's more proficient in CS than many UCLA freshmen/sophomores. He started off in Python Level 1 with no CS experience, and since then has progressed all the way to the end of Java Level 3. I've been his instructor the entire time, teaching him twice a week every week for two years. Now he splits his time between Java Level 3 and USACO courses.

I've really come to view George as my peer - he really enjoys in-depth explanations of concepts, and strives to have a deep understanding of everything that's happening in a project. I frequently end up touching on advanced concepts during class, which he enjoys.

If George chooses to take our AP Computer Science course, it will certainly be pretty much all review for him. He will improve his CS skills the most through consistent practice, though, so it could still be good. He may also choose to focus entirely on USACO courses, which would also be a great decision. 

He has serious potential for an exceptional career in computer science, especially given his age. 

A good instructor for George will select / create challenging problems for George to complete for homework. Due to the lack of supplemental projects in Java L3, I've recently started assigning him leetcode problems for homework.
