famous

bitch you know i'm famous
moreso than amos
beyond rhianna, rick and morty, obama, and batman there's me
lookin over the place to parley a bite to eat

riding down sunset, see my face on every street


i'm an enormous figure


then have an interview
answer a question or two
reporter play it back, writing notes for the news
usin shit I'm spittin straight to pay his dues






without discussion or concussions shit is easily spewed
over production and percussions that'll pop you too

even though I'm not religious never hit no pews
I still know that I stay spittin magically imbued
words that'll rock your moccassins back to the moon
