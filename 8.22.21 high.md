famous

bitch you know i'm famous
moreso than amos
beyond rhianna, rick and morty, obama, and batman there's me
lookin over the place to parley a bite to eat

riding down sunset, see my face on every street


i'm an enormous figure


then have an interview
answer a question or two
reporter play it back, writing notes for the news
usin shit I'm spittin straight to pay his dues
