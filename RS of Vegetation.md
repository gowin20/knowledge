Most important information for sensing vegatation: [[Spectral Resolution|Spectral Reflectance]]
# Spectral Reflectance

# Leaf Reflectance

The spectral signature of vegetation, especially trees, varies greatly because leaves change color! Allows us to analyze different species of tree pretty easily

### Factors Controlling Leaf Reflectance

Difference between the Near-infrared and the Middle infrared
- in middle infrared, we are able to see the water content in the leaves which allows us to determine plant health

| Band            | Range   | remembering      |
| --------------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| Near-Infrared   | 0.7-1.3 | lucky -> unlucky |
| Middle-Infrared | 1.3-2.6 | double the start |
|                 |         |                  |

Healthiest: 100% water content <-> Unhealthiest: 5% water content

Additional spectral signatures allow us to classify different types of crops as well, check it out:
