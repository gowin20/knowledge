**4.13.21:** Now that I've migrated much of my knowledge from Notion to Obsidian, I should begin the ongoing process of **decentralizing my notes**. Currently most knowledge is stored in markdown tables full of links, a holdover from Notion. While this is a great way to make notes navigable, more meaningful connections can be built on top of this. It's time to take a second pass at my knowledge, and iteratively link connections together. This will help my life out SO much, FOREVER. This will be my garden, forever.
