Definitely want to talk about:
- I'd like to quit smoking, drinking eventually, or at least think it could be good for my life. I like doing it though, especially since i'm in college - what's my timeline? is that getting too serious too quickly? how do i decide this stuff for myself?

- friend wants me to film a movie today and it's nervewracking, but I want to adopt a mindset of it empowering me

- my roommate, Tate, is perpetually doing badly and told me heavy stuff

- weird feelings of temptation recently, and i think I know what i should do but it's still weird
