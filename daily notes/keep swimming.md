I know how excited we all were for the summer accelerator, and how much effort we put in to our application process. Personally, I thought we were a shoe-in, and everything they said to us corroborated that.

While this is demoralizing as hell and honestly depressing as fuck, our ship sails on. We've navigated well to get this far, and we still have bountiful waters ahead. We've created a legitimately awesome product, and are starting to get genuine interest in it. This rejection, while certainly a blow, is superceded for me by how many other potential avenues of monetization and expansion we have. 

We're unlike other startups in that cash is not our fundamental priority. I think this is a good wake-up call for us to assess what we really want out of this.
- We have potential to become an actual startup with actual monetization strategies, like we've been planning for thus far.
- We also have potential to become an official UCLA service sponsored by the school
- Additionally, we have the potential to become a non-profit with the sole mission of fostering creation, sponsored by wealthy patrons of the arts.
We have myriad options available to us, all of which fulfill our true goal of providing a space for the next creative renaissance. Let's take time tonight to mourn our loss here, but know that the future still has great things in stock for Cobble and for us.
