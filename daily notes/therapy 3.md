yeah


what else is there to talk about right now?


should probably go to a CAPS person


feeling distant from my girlfriend?

disassociating
felt like shreya was talking to daniel and not me


nashville people?

no funding for cobble
spending too much time on it?

message jawan letting him know how close, how much it would mean if we lived together
express honest feelings


care about you, good friend who went through a hard time
take responsibility for yourself. when you say you're gonna do something, expect you to follow through

do the best we can, humans screw up sometimes
