let's figure out where my head is at right now

I'm
- anxious and worried about Cobble's startup accelerator application process
- anxious that Oliver will fall through
- anxious that Jawan will fall through


Jawan is supposed to be our visionary. He's writing the rhetoric and leading the MOVEMENT behind cobble, rather than cobble's business component. 

Oliver is supposed to be our head of development. He should be pushing the team to be better, and there constantly to help get shit done
for the most part, he absolutely does this. However, he hasn't done that much work himself over the last few weeks. He's still getting it done for some part though, which is okay

I want Oliver to bring his A game in life. He's exceptionally talented and intelligent, but has struggled so much with motivation and discipline. He seems unhappy much of the time, which can in some part be attributed to his sleep schedule and mobilization habits. He's doing okay for the most part, though.

I care about Oliver as a friend, and wish for him to find happiness and his true self

I care about Oliver as a roommate, and want him to fulfill his obligations to the house (dishes etc)

I care about Oliver as a teammate and co-founder, and want to make sure he doesn't stall Cobble's development cycle. I also want him to bring his A game to important meetings





haha yes!
