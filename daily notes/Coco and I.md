what an absolutely insane circumstance I've found myself in.

Coco and I are already close - in the last 9 days, Coco and I have gone from casual acquaintances to friends at the level of calling each other at 1am to talk for 30 minutes about all the shit going on in our lives. The crazy thing is, it seems like we're emotionally in very similar places right now. Or rather, we're both experiencing the same crazy feelings under the hood which manifest in different ways.

She's having relationship doubts with Oliver, doubts as to whether she even wants to be in a committed relationship with him. This makes sense, due to her getting out of a 1.5yr relationship just over a month ago. She expressed this to me, and said that she hopes spending about 2 months apart from him would help




I feel like what I've been thinking is better classified as a hypothetical. I'm famously BAD BAD BAD at reading these kind of situations, especially when Oliver is involved. I had a fucking comical situation with Shreya freshman year which I'll never forget about, and this felt like it could be very much the same.

My hypothetical, in my head, is that Coco is inexplicably drawn to me. I don't know if it's because of attraction or simply just heavy energy resonance, but she's drawn to me in the same way that I'm drawn to her. Especially since we did Kratom, it felt like what we have just *works* in a way that nobody else really does.

I probably feel this way because I feel drawn to her. But I need to question like, how drawn to her am I *really?* How much of it is the excitement of new things, piercings, meeting new people, etc.? The thing is, right now in my head Coco seems like the key to all of that man! So it's hard for me to know I guess.
I think the majority of my "drawn to her"-ness is as a friend. We are great friends, and make great friends, and will/should stay great friends. But when I sit next to her on the couch, I want to hold her hand and put my arm around her. Those aren't feelings I should be feeling for people other than Shreya. Even if she doesn't reciprocate them.

If she does, it's arguably worse! That would create tension both between the two of us and between literally every other person in my life. Not as much hers, but mine. ESPECIALLY Oliver, Daniel, and Shreya, my ride or dies. Nobody is worth that, right? Nobody is worth that.

I just want it all man.

This is a fucking poetic circumstance, if it happened it would be. Coco is supposed to like this guy Oliver, but instead develops feelings for his close friend and roommate George - who happens to have the same name as her ex, who she just got out of a big relationship with. George is in a relationship, but finds himself drawn to Coco as well. Partially out of attraction and partially out of spite for Oliver, he hooks up with Coco and causes this massive rift. They both want what they cannot have. It's friendgroup suicide, which makes it way way hotter.

that's not the situation I find myself in, however. Here's what it should be:

George is in a committed relationship with a wonderful woman Shreya, but meets and becomes close to someone named Coco, who is romantically involved with George's friend. Despite being drawn to her - and even perhaps despite her feeling the same way about him - they know that because of their situation, anything between them was never meant to be. 

When you plant a particuraly lively tree under the steps, all it has to grow on are those little beams of light that shine through the slats in the wood. Even coming intermittently, those slats provide just enough light for the tree to germinate and even sprout. However, the life of the tree is fundamentally limited by its environment. Even if it somehow receives enough light and nutrients to grow larger, it will never be able to exceed the confines of the steps around it. The only way it could ever grow would be by destroying the steps it resides beneath.

For this reason, don't water the tree under the steps. Water the tree in the open field, of the same variety which has already grown nice and strong. It's got a great life ahead, and will be able to provide and grow perhaps to heights that no tree has seen before.
