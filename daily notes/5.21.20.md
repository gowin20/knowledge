it's 5:30 and i'm not sure what to do. I know i have a ton of math homework, as well as a class and eminent dinner with my family, but i don't really feel motivated to do any of those things.

I just took a geogrpahy quiz, which is good, but there's just not a lot of motivation in my head right now.

I want to:
- Play Heroes of the Storm
- Talk to my friends and girlfriend
- get really high / drunk tonight
- sleep for several days


I should do:
- my math homework
- Studying for my math midterm on Monday
- set up [[my system]], continue to write more


# I want to write every day! Writing makes me feel good!



i'm not even sure what all to write here. I feel like there's **so much** to unpack, especially since i haven't written anything in my journal for nearly the entire quarter. I seriously am apprehensive about getting started here, just because i feel like it's gonna be lossy.


[[System Setting]]
report - what I did on that day
journal - larger scale concepts
