I want to stay with Shreya. at least for now. What does that mean? let's take a real look at that.

Well, we've been pretty distant for about the last 2 weeks. 


before that, 

we had initial dififculties when I talked about uncertainty in general. She cried for a while - I think that was on Sunday or Monday, the 27th/28th


the first "break" began on Wednesday June 30th, resulting from some stuff I said about being uncertain about the future. That was after my therapy session. That night I think I went to watch JJK with people. 
we were on a "semi-break" or smth over the weekend. Even though we talked still, and even hung out, it was much more awkward between us (ofc caused by me).

On Monday, the 5th, we had a relationship talk and haven't spoken since then - 5 days. The night before was the 4th of july party, leaving me with lots of doubts honestly because of my interactions with Fionna and Coco.

I've definitely been attracted to Fionna, but I have felt a whole fucking lot of romantic infatuation with Coco. That's really been the source of a LOT of my issues throughout all of this. Now, Coco is sitting in Oliver's bed across from me as I'm writing this. We're both just working together and vibing which is nice.

I need to process this out. From conversations we've had and the way that she's acted around me, I understand that she has some level of romantic feelings for me. Things she's said make it definitely clear! And it's also clear that she's really confused right now.

On my end, I've felt some level of romantic feelings for her as well. I think Coco has some idea of that, if I'm being honest. I hope it's also clear that I'm really confused right now too.

We're in a very asymmetrical situation, but it's clear that we both feel relatively the same ways about each other and don't know what to do haha.

I posit (for the umpteenth time) that nothing will ever happen between us, and a relationship between us will never work
- coco also likes oliver
- same name as her ex
- shreya and I's relationship is wayyyy better and stronger and should be cherished
so, it's clear that we should just be friends! It's so hard though, because every time I see her I just want to hug her and cuddle. Cuddling with Fionna has been a good outlet for that, but I really miss holding Shreya. It's been hard for me to feel that recently - missing Shreya. I feel like if I miss her, all of this shit that's been built up around me for the last two weeks will come crumbling down. The reality is, my entire life that I've built up, especially in the last two weeks, has a Shreya-shaped hole at its center. I'm running and moving all the time in order to ignore that. Even now I don't plan to dwell on it for very long at all - I will soon go to a nice vegan restaurant and then go clubbling haha. But I know that there's a Shreya-shaped hole in my heart, the person who I've spent the last year with and the person who makes me happier than anyone else can. We fight a lot, though. I want to feel happy and not sad in my relationship, since I've proven that it's easily possible to feel happy when I'm "not in a relationship": not through hooking up with other people, but from simply being genuinely social all the time.

I want to be social all the fucking time, and the last two weeks have been a proof of concept for that.



what I want out of a relationship:

- emotional support, someone to lean on when I'm going through things or talk to when good things happen. someone to talk to all the time and send memes to
- someone I share a close bond with
- someone I can talk to super easily and love spending time with
- someone who loves to do things with me
- someone who is physically attracted to me, and likes having sex with me and vice versa. We do kinky stuff
- someone who lets me cuddle with other people (not hook up with or anything, just be physically intimate)



I think that's all reasonable. What i need now, is a concrete plan to help with the sexual issues I've been having in our relationship. Something to give to Shreya tomorrow, as a sign that I'm invested in this relationship.

- see a doctor as soon as possible about this sex stuff, and follow it to completion please
- let's try to have sex as often as we can over the summer
- physical intimacy
- dress slutty to things together
- support me exploring my slutty side



beyond sex
- be positive in the way you view the world. react positively to things, especially those that I tell you
- open and exploratory to new things
- allow me to do things with other people without feeling jealous (i don't want to sacrifice my life out of a feeling of obligation to our relationship, that will kill it. sometimes space is just healthier and better for expanding circles)
- let's talk and chat about all the good times we have. and the bad ones too hehe

now i'm not sure how to turn all of that into concrete, implementable metrics. I should give them another pass in the morning, then talk to Shreya with a couple metrics in mind. we can figure it out together.

I'm like crying now lol. Does she still want to stay with me? She'd have every right to break up with me right now. I hope she believes that I didn't cheat on her (THE TRUTH)

 

fuckkkkkkkkk
