#dream
writing about myself, writing about my life and memories and experience. I crave that. I need to process everything. This is what I need to do this quarter, be with myself and process myself

I had a bad dream last night.

I was at Daniel and Shreya's house, very drunk and sitting on the couch. Daniel came out and told me that I owed him $100, and that I needed to pay him right away. He seemed super displeased with me - he was handling me like someone he didn't want to be around at all.

I was kinda slurring my words and confused. Eventually he left

Then Shreya came out. I was sitting on the couch with my laptop open, and she sat down and started saying a bunch of really depressing stuff

issues her and Daniel had with me, issues going back for weeks. I don't remember the specifics, but they felt like things that happened as a result of me just being myself. They weren't okay with that.

I started freaking out and yelling, and Shreya dissappeared

I tried to follow her into her room, but the door was blocked by piles and piles of laundry.

Daniel was behind me and told me Shryea's in the bathroom, and doesn't want to talk

I walked out to the kitchen to wash my hands - for some reason, the water was hot even though i turned on the cold tap. I had to turn the hot tap afterwards

I went back to the couch. Daniel came out and closed the door
"snapple is shut in. You're free to go"
he was asking me to leave.

I started FREAKING out

nobody wanted to talk to me, nobody even cared to work it out or explain to me. They just wanted me out of their lives

:(

that's when I woke up
