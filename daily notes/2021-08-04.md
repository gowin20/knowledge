# Response to Shreya


To respond to what you're saying, Shreya:

I see how my messages were rude, and I'm sorry.
Here they are for context:
>Idk what you're doing here i literally just said I'm down to go with you
Like what???
Not being fair to me
I feel guilt tripped for 'not appearing enthusiastic enough'

I started off on the wrong foot by immediately criticizing you. "Idk what you're doing here" is rude and accusatory, I'm sorry that I said that. Same with my phrasing of "I literally just said I'm down to go with you", it was inflammatory. The "Like what???" just drove it home further.

The semantic content of these two messages should have been "I explicitly said I was down, but now you're assuming I'm not. that's frustrating to me". Instead it became accusatory and upsetting, I'm sorry about that.

> not being fair to me
I feel guilt tripped for 'not appearing enthusiastic enough'

It did feel like you were guilt tripping me, and that is unfair. That's what I intended to communicate in my later message as well, when I said that it was kind of manipulative. You apologized for being passive aggressive already, which is a similar thing.

> that's a lot of deleted messages
> [...]
> What is going on

These messages were rude as well. Needlessly calling attention to all of the deleted messages isn't productive, and only ended up undermining how you must have been feeling. I'm sorry.

> I seriously don't intend to be rude to you or mean
> I just felt like that last message was kind of manipulative

I still mean both of these things. I see now that several messages that I sent were indeed rude, and I'm sorry again for that. Definitely not okay. I want to improve at communicating how I'm feeling without being rude or aggressive.
Like I mentioned before, I stand by the statement that I believe your initial message to have been manipulative. I've had plenty of bad experiences in past relationships with that kind of thing, so I'm definitely on high alert. That is how I feel, and it's valid of me to bring attention to it.


I know I sent a few more messages during the conversation we had later, but these initial messages were the ones which upset you, and are the most important to address.
I hope that this writeup helps you understand where I was coming from, and that I genuinely feel bad for being rude to you. I want to empathize with how you're feeling, and this is my best effort. 

Now I want to acknowledge some of the things you sent in the subsequent conversation. You mentioned that in the past, you've expressed that "sure" makes you doubt that I actually want to do something with you. You said you genuinely didn't feel like I wanted to come. I know you've expressed that in the past, and I want to do a better job at respecting that. However, my message of "sure yeah" explicitly said I wanted to go to DipnMix with you, and I definitely do of course. 

When you said 
>I genuinely didn't feel like you wanted to come based on your message

I felt unheard, because my message in question explicitly said the exact opposite of that.

I reread the rest of what you sent to me, but the only other specific thing I could find was
> no ask for clarification, or explanation that you do or don't want to go

I want to reiterate that I absolutely do want to go with you. I initially felt additional explanation was unnecessary because I have not once implied in any way whatsoever that I do not want to go with you. I absolutely want to go with you, and I think it'd be a lot of fun! I'm excited to get different little crepes and mix and match flavor combinations and spreads. They have Acai too! It seems like your kind of place and I'd definitely like to go of course.

I'd appreciate it if you could now tell me what problematic aspects of my messages I missed here, and maybe elaborate a little bit more from your perspective. Please let me know more specifically what you mean by messages like "everything you said is shitty and rude and completely just attacking me".
