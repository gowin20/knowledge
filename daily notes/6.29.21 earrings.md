time to pierce my ears! I'll write in here tomorrow to make sure i'm okay :(

well i had a whole day of pierced ears. I'll talk about it more in the [[6.30.21]] entry since it's no longer this day

highlights:
- pierced ears!
- helped Kristin move
- hung out with Coco
- did kratom
- reconnected / met Josh
- watched a great new anime
- got really drunk, had a successful board game night
- coco spent the night



- shreya was sad all day, constantly texting me and deleting messages and i wasn't sure what to do
- bared my heart to coco and ethan about it, and how it's fuckin me up
