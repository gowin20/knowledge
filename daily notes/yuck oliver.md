:(

oliver stormed out of the meeting and told me "you're being an asshole"

i just want what's best for cobble
not my intention to be an asshole, and I'm sorry that my tone was abrasive


you've put in much less work on cobble over the last 2 weeks, and for 2 weeks in a row now you haven't made progress on many tasks

i know you're still putting some work into cobble, but it's much less than the responsibility you took on

idk like i asked if this was too much last week and you insisted it was fine, but then none of it has gotten done


you literally weren't paying attention at all during the meeting, you're right behind me and i can see you working on that REA shit
you didn't even devote like UGH



i care more about communication than anything
you didn't respond to my message on discord, and from how you were talking in the meeting today it seems like you didn't even read it. The thing is, I even talked to you about it in person yesterday too, so it's kinda getting to me that you didn't even bother to read or respond to it


to be honest, i've got problems with you that extend way beyond cobble. I'm trying to compartmentalize everything but i'm just like constantly cleaning up your messes in the apartment

you leave lights on, you spill shit on the floor and just leave it there, you leave your fucking chicken bones on the kitchen counter, you leave your plates and cups everywhere, you don't do the dishes,  you get ash on every table in the house, you leave the oven on for hours and have almost started a fire multiple times - you make every shared space in here a fucking mess and then don't clean up after yourself

when i ask you to clean up, or to do stuff, you say "yeah i'll do it" and then simply do not, ever.

like it's been a while here - i could just go on and on about things you haven't done in the house
I've let go of a lot of stuff and I'm not trying to say that I'm holding a grudge against you for shit that happened a while back

but i've put up with a lot as your roommate, and you need to be aware of that.

i totally get it that you have different standards for cleanliness and comort levels with filth, that makes sense
but you're living in a shared space, and while we're living together you have an obligation to keep this place livable for other people


honestly for a long time, I rationalized this as "oh he's not doing shit for the house, but it's okay because he's working on Cobble instead and that's helping me in a way"
but now you're not even doing that. it probably feels like your tasks are piling up and shit
