### Gratitude
I'm incredibly grateful for the wonderful people and support system I have in my life. I finally got around to responding to people today - though I still must respond to Fionna - and I really am happy that people are so understanding. I intend to be SO MUCH BETTER ABOUT RESPONDING TO TEXTS! For the most part I am, but recently the number of people I communicate with has increased signifigantly, and it's quite difficult to actually respond to everyone. That's not recusing myself, because I certainly do have issues still. However, this section is about gratitude.

I have had a good, slow day. My brain certainly feels like it's running slower than usually - honestly half of it feels like it's in the Grand Line. I finished all of Thriller Bark from start to finish, as well as some chapters leading up to it. It's insane that I can go through that entire arc in a day, when watching the anime would take like 24 hours of uninterrupted TV for the same. My retention is probably lower, but it's a reread anyways so who cares lol. My hand hurt a little bit, and I'm looking forward to walking to tacos since it'll give me a chance to actually move around.

Tonight I'm excited to live entirely in the moment. I will respond to Fionna now, and completely live in the moment as I go to get Tacos. I'll purchase a redbull, and come back to my apartment to an awesome party! It'll be so much fun. I'm excited to meet new people, party with Teddy, Ethan, Matt, and Carson, and show the world how amazing of a person I am. It'll be good - more than good, it'll be amazing and fun!

Then I can wake up for my 10am discussion tomorrow, even if hungover.
