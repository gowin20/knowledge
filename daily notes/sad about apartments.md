I don't even know how to cope with my feelings right now. I'm overwhelmed with sadness, and obsessively comparing my life to a manga. My head is really in there

It's easy to compare when there's so many parallels. Obviously not the additional complications of "Domestic Girlfriend", but the general feeling of causing pain to others is something I'm resonating with right now.

I pulled out of Daniel, Shreya, and Emilye's lease last-minute, and now it's thrown Daniel/Shreya/Emilye into a whole bunch of stressful negotiations

They're thinking about leasing with 3 people only, and Emilye gets their own room. Daniel and Shryea each pay 200 /month more, while Emilye pays 500/month more. I'm internalizing the fact that I'm likely going to cause them each to be paying signifigantly more money than they were previously. I hope Emilye actually lives there

On top of this, I'm suffering my own complications about leasing. Jawan still hasn't 100% committed to this, and the leasing agent says we need to completely re-apply, which is going to mean a hectic week of co-signers etc. I need to respond to that email saying that I'll get everything in order
