[[jeremiah meeting]]


i feel like a fucking mess right now. I need to process my emotions tonight before hanging out with Coco and Kristin and Josh. Fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk


dude i'm like a mess

did I basically break up with Shreya today? That's pretty much what I said to her, except I then said that I wanted to stay together but wasn't sure.

I feel like an asshole
I feel even worse because i'm not even like that broken up over this right now. Like what the fuck is wrong with me?
I can't help but think about other women, even right now. Maybe that's my way of coping for how badly I just hurt Shreya

I really think I might be psychopathic, or at lease exhibit those tendencies. My mind is diseased or something, because I have no idea why I'm like this. My mind tells me to go for Coco. Coco. Coco. Why? Literally one of my close friends has said he's emotionally attached to her, which he almost never is. Plus I'm in a good relationship... or at least I think I was, fuck. It's not too late to get Shreya back, but I'm not sure what to do. 

And why am I STILL infatuated with Coco? Honestly I kinda like both Coco AND Kristin. Kristin is single, attractive, high sex drive, and seems like a really amazing person that's had to overcome a lot in her life. However I honestly value BOTH of them more as friends than anything else. I kinda fear that if I break up with Shreya, it will destabilize our friendships. When I'm single, all of my relationships with women are much more volatile. I think that's because I have this problem where I sometimes become truly different when I'm horny. It's fucking insane how different I can be - I don't like it. If I'm single, I fear that it's just a matter of time until I say some weird shit or make some weird move. When emilye was woman, them and Shreya were like my 2 close female friends. I'm still close with both but I literally did ask both of them out. It's like I'm biologically incapable of being friends with women without being attracted to them. WHY! Literally this goes all the way back to the incest shit as well. I haven't really written about that EVER, but the gist is I have this perverted desire to sexualize the women closest to me. Even my mother and sister. Not good, and I don't know what to do about it.

oh I'm friends with Chloe as well, but I had a little pda with her at some point but she's in a relationship. Literally I want to fuck everything that moves. Not just people close to me, but especially them because of how often I see them. I usually get off at least twice a day, which is like way too much. My sex drive is so high. I do feel like it'd be better to be with someone who also possesses a high sex drive, so that we can satisfy each other. Part of me thinks it could be better to not, though - if I date someone with a low sex drive will these bad intentions and intrusive thoughts go away? After dating Shreya for a year and a half - much lower sex drive than me - I don't really think they have. However, they did some I guess.

Honestly with this incest stuff, I got really into it in like freshman year of college - specifically reading stories about other people's experiences online. I don't think I have fantasized about my sister since like sophomore year of high school. Junior/Senior year I kinda completely stopped. Maybe it was because I was actually having lots of good sex with Jessica. I feel like sex drive is important to me yeah idk.


but i really fucking vibe with shreya. I don't know. i feel like the sadness is setting in now. No interest in making any moves on anyone close to me, not tonight or for the forseeable future.

honestly I would fucking LOVE to get with Izcally, she seems like an intelligent and attractive woman, with great taste. All I need to do is like Tyler the Creator lol, who i'm FUCKING OBSESSED WITH WOW! that's a joke but I really have been searching for someone to connect with about Tyler. None of my friends are as passionate about him as I am, at least not in this very moment.

I'm also interested in cultivating a *genuine friendship* with Emma Dundon. She seems like such a cool person, and I have the perfect reason to talk to her now. I just hope we have enough in common to be friends!
