I miss you right now. We just played avalon, and I totally wished u were there the entire time. I also think you'd really love Kristin and Saagrika, as well as Fionna maybe. Im a little worried about me and Fionna. Im not sure what to do. We're both really really attracted to each other, and she's even leaving me cute little notes and cuddling with me all the time. Today we cooked lunch together at her place, and talked and held hands on the balcony together the whole time. She's very physically intimate with all of her friends, even male (carson+raziv), but wayyy more so with me. I've never seen her hold carsons hand, but we hold hands kinda frequently. Her presence is really comforting to me, but it's honestly filling a void left by you? I'm not sure. I just really like her.

I also like Coco. Honestly my thoughts are a mess. Coco is fucking amazing, and has the perfect personality. We get along so well and it's just amazing. I know for a fact she likes me too - she likes Oliver as well as me, and is confused. I don't think anything will ever hapen between us, as we definitely have a tacit understanding. A conversation might be warranted, but I just want to stay friends.

To be clear it's not like I'm crhshing on all female people in my life - not really romantically into Kristin at all. I genuinely feel strong romantic connection between me and Fjonna, like really strong. Coco and I have a special bond as well. I love easily - that's something I've learned about myself, that I don't really trust in myself. So much of this is fueled by pent up sexual energy. Both fionna and I really wanna fuck to be honest, and I think about kissing her a lot. We definitely could make out and she'd be fucking extremely down i think. The tension between us is hot. My thoughts on this are so cloudy I need to jack it before rly thinking

Probably not worth sacrificing my relationship- that definitely should be obvious, but it doesn't sem thst way. I need to get off hahaa

it's the next day now, and I need to write. I've got about an hour before going out tonight, which should be enough time to come to some concrete conclusions hopefully. As I'm writing this, Coco is in the next room in her fourth hour of meetings. She's so impressive and cool. This whole day i've had an irrational urge to hug her. probably not a good feeling to feel ugh

on obs


I think some of the shit i said here be dumb as fuck honestly. coco talked to me for a while yesterday about how she really likes oliver, and is starting to like him more, and I just felt like I'd been so deluded. I was convinced that she liked me in some form! and she might, but it's clear that she likes oliver and wants to pursue that. once she said she'd been hardcore crushing on ollie, it felt like a huge weight was lifted off of my chest. for that ride to gracias madre, i felt progressively better and better the entire time. By the time we ate and got back, it was like wayyyy better haha. Then we talked more, did kratom, went and drank, and went to da club. Honestly a great fucking night to end off a great fucking day with coco.

I just fucking LOVE HANGING OUT WITH COCO HOLY SHIT! it's insane how much we get along. I want to literally be best friends with her, i'm so down. I want her to be like how Daniel is for Shreya. idk how sustainable that is, but 100% that's how it's been for the last multiple weeks. Having romantic thoughts about her is self-destructive - I need to recognize that deluded part of my personality and disregard it. I've been leaning into it recently, but I honestly love our friendship so much and don't want anything to jeapordize it. that's so important to me haha.

what I've got going on in my life right now is FUCKING GREAT and SHREYA WILL BE THE PERFECT MISSING COMPONENT! I can't wait for her to meet Kristin and Saagarika, i think they'd get along really fucking well. Imagine Kristin, Saagarika, Daniel, Shreya, and I for a board game night?? Literally I cannot. I'm down.
dude that sounds fucking FUN AS FUCK! It will happen. it will happen as soon as i get back from nashville lol

pretty sad that coco isn't gonna be here when I get back. We'll still talk online - I just wanna be like really close friends. Even if her and oliver start dating, and even if they subsequently break up, I'm ride or die team Coco right now. I will still be friends with both lol.

who else? Josh is great too, I feel like he was what I've been missing in college for so long for some reason. Can't pinpoint what it is, but he's great and I love him. Additionally, Amanda is actually cool! I like her. She's very like hard to read, and sometimes I think there's a lot of awkward silences. but she's clearly very intelligent, has a sense of humor similar to Josh, and is okay as a person. Good enough to vibe with! we won't ever be close I don't think, though.

Honestly kristin, saagarika, coco, fiona, josh: I've gotten so much closer to all of them recently and it's been amazing. I'm sad that 3 of them might not live here in the fall, but that just mean we need to make the most of the time we do have together.

party time tonight. before that, talk with shreya time. in between, nap time.
