Okay. I need to be on my shit today! More generally, I just need to get my shit together in general. I feel like I'm slipping on several aspects of my life, and today is a good opportunity to rekindle my fires. My intention is to work for most of the night, productively accomplish both schoolwork and career-advancing work, and feel a little better about myself and my status by the end of the day than I do now.

god i'm just so overwhelmed wow
