continuing my efforts to write every day! it's 1:35am and i'm pretty tired.

Today I saw EVAN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 5 MONTHS! It was so much fun! We went to bradshaw's house, and I honestly REALLY vibed with bradshaw the entire time I was there. He's attentive and a great listener, and we didn't broach any subjects we disagreed on. Great lad. His backyard is fucking amazing too, with a beautiful enclosed garden home to cats, birds, and fish.

I saw my dad as well - so great to talk to him, as ALWAYS. I love him!

Overall a pretty good day. Even Cobble got a lot done marketing-wise. good shit good shit
