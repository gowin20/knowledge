sadness has overtaken me. it's been creeping for days, in my free time. now it's here / arriving. I hope it doesn't last for too long. I'm okay with it, though. it really arrived once evan and others were there at my place.

sadness can leave you feeling that the world around you is rejecting you

I need to accept my feelings and channel them into the proper directions. Let them flow through me freely, in and out, and let them shape the parts of me they touch along the way.


Human beings are like a perfect machine. Our bodies and brains exist to be shaped, and we have agency in their shaping. 

How do i resolve my belief in that, with the seeming lack of existence of free will?






how do i tell shreya that fionna and I cuddled?

i obviously have NO intention of doing ANYTHING with her. I will NEVER cheat on you, period

we have, a couple times, leaned on each other on the couch and held hands. One time her, carson, and I cuddled together lol

obviously nothing sexual, completely platonic. I'm just a physical person and like to do that with friends. I just wanted to tell you this upfront, seeing as how she is a woman

at my party, I actually talked to her about setting clear boundaries. I'm in a relationship and so is she, even though hers is open. So, I basically told her that I enjoy cuddling / being touchy with friends and it is completely platonic, we are in complete agreeance that that's all it is.

I'm sorry to tell you about this but I feel like I should.
