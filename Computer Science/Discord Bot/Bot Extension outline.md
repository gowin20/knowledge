# Bot Extension outline

Transforming a poker program into a poker bot will be no small task. There's tons of additional functionality I need to add in order to accomplish something like this. At a glance, some of the changes I need to make are:

- Enable multiple players to be in the game
    - Requires reading player names
    - Player class
- Add images for the cards
- Work out how to get a bot to DM players
- announcements
- LOTS of command functionality
