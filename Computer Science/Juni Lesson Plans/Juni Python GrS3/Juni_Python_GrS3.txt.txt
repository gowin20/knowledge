Variables - do you know what it is?

Used to store something that changes - they're 'dynamic'

use them to keep track of things - like your score in a game
if we wanted to make a basketball game, we'd have a variable to keep track of your points

we can use variables with random numbers to make our shapes appear in random spots on the screen

random numbers
import random
importing the random library - just like real libraries, these contain all sorts of information we can use.
like what we did with import turtle


random.randint(0,200)
screen is big - the part around us on our screen is from -300 to 300 in both x & y


store random int in a variables

nested loops - make the computer draw lots of squares


--polka dots -
	make a new project, try to make it by using your square code and changing as little as possible
	
--try to make a starry night. do the same thing we did with circles, for stars - you could even change the background and add other things to it


screen = turtle.Screen()
