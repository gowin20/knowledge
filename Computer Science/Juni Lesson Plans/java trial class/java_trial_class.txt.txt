Java Trial Lesson

introductions

coding - we're gonna be using Java

repl.it

a variable
primitive types:

	int - integer, bascially a positive or negative number

	double - decimal numbers

	char - a character, bascially a button on your keyboard. Anything from 'a' to 'z' to '6' to '.'

	boolean - either true or false, helps us keep track of things like an on/off switch

//

Strings
	objects, not a primitive type - they're actually made of a bunch of characters, like an array


output:
	System.out.println(word);
	
input:
	more complicated. There's 4 steps in total
	
	import Scanner class,
		import java.util.Scanner;
	create our scanner, which will listen for words
		Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in); #our scanner uses the input we typed into the console
	ask a question
		System.out.print("what's your name? "); #note that by using print instead of println, the user can answer the question on the same line we ask
	get the input
		String answer = in.nextLine();
