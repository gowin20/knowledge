# Introductions

You guys must be ______ and ______! It's nice to meet you :) (see you again for kunal)

How do you guys know each other?

how old are you guys? What grade are you in now?

What kind of stuff do you guys like to do for fun together?

What kind of video games do you play?

I'm George! I study computer science at UCLA, and love playing video games and board games. I also hike and have done lots of other stuff, like all the stuff

Let's talk about programming! What kind of programming experience do you guys have? Can you remember any languages you've programmed in before?

For this course, we're going to be programming in a language called Python.

Everything is done through the Juni Learning portal. We can check out "My Code" and look at all the projects together

# PS1: The Basics

We're gonna start with the fundamentals of Python. 

- Variables
- Input
- String Stuff
- General Python Stuff

This is really useful stuff, because it's applicable to every other programming language too! In fact, concepts like "variables" are kinda universal, and we see them in subjects like Math as well.

On that note, let's talk about variables.

## Variables (do this on an empty repl)

Do you know what a variable is? Where have you guys heard that term before?

A variable is a symbol which represents a piece of information. We usually think of variables as storing numbers - like in math - but they can actually store all kinds of different information! For example, I could also make a variable which represents words or sentences

The most important aspect of a variable is that it can CHANGE - that's why we call it a variable, because it can vary

We care about two types of variables today: Integers and Strings

- Explain these

## Input

To ask the user for input, use the function

```python
name = input('Enter your name!')
```

This will print out the message "Enter your name!", prompting the user to say something in response

The user will type something, and when they hit enter, whatever they type will be stored in the "name" variable
