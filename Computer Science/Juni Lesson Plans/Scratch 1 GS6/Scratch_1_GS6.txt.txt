Advanced Conditionals


what is a conditional?
	
	
if/else:

	if it's cold/raining outside, get a jacket
	otherwise (else) you don't need to wear one
	^that could actually be done without the else
	
	if you finish your homework, you can play minecraft
	otherwise, you're grounded
	
	if you find the answer, stop
	otherwise keep trying
	
homework:

finish/enhace upon the hungry dinosaur project
show your project to a friend/family, tell them a little bit about how you made it


incorporate something else that uses an if/else block:

try to add a meteor to the hungry dinosaur game, that moves across the screen in random coordinates

add a spider that follows the dinosaur (and moves slower than it!) if they're touching, make the dino say "ow" and the spider say "muahuahahaha" or something
