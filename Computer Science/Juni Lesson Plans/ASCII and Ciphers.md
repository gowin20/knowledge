# Teach Ascii First

- [x]  Explain what Ascii is
    - [x]  Computers can only use numbers, so we need a way to convert our human languages into numbers that our computer can understand
    - [x]  Common formats: ASCII, Unicode, EBCDIC (lol nobody uses that)
    - [ ]  Link to asciitable: [http://www.asciitable.com/](http://www.asciitable.com/)
- [x]  Ascii Exercises
    - [x]  Convert a character to ascii with ord()
    - [x]  Write your name in ascii with chr()
    - [x]  Print the alphabet using an ascii loop

# Transition to Cipher

- [x]  Write a program which takes input, and converts the characters to ASCII
    - [x]  Input: Any string
    - [x]  Output: that string's ASCII representation (could do each character on a newline, doesn't matter if it looks good)

# Cipher

- [ ]  What is a Cipher?
    - [ ]  Way of encrypting messages, so they're secret
    - [ ]  only the person with the key can decrypt them
- [ ]  Simple Cipher
- [ ]  Caesar Cipher
