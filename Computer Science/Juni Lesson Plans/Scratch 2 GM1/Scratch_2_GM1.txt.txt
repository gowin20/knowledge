Scratch 2 GM1

Get that foundation going

Ask him about:




	Event Listeners (Dragonfly events)
	Loops (random shapes)
	Conditionals (Math Facts)
	Variables (Speed Click)
	Message Broadcasting (Dance off)
		It's kind of like a signal you give to your friend
		It's like you're texting your friend
		A command one sprite gives to another



if he seems to get a concept pretty easily, move on to the next one:

event listeners shouldn't be that hard
loops includes event listeners

If he knows abt listeners, start on shapes
if he knows loops, start on conditionals

etc.
