# How is Java different from Python?

- White space doesn't matter
- Semicolons
- Parentheses, curly braces
- Everything is a class
- strict type definition
- generally write more
- Different syntax for things
- methods instead of functions

# How are Python and Java the same?

- programming languages!
    - even though the syntax is different, both languages can be used to communicate with computers, and are often used to accomplish the same things. It's like speaking to someone in Spanish, instead of English
- use the same data types
- capable of doing the same things in both!
