A discord bot which is built to offer functionality for the Sbeve discord server. It serves several various functions, outlined here.

## RNG Bot

$$-flip$$

- returns heads or tails. It's 50/50!

$$-roll\ \ n$$

- returns the result of rolling an n-sided die

$$-randhand \ \ n$$

- will play out a randomized poker hand with "n" players to determine who wins. Mini version of the actual thing without DMing anyone
    - Sends the board in 3 messages: flop, turn, river, then shows each respective person's hand
- other RNG stuff? we can literally do anything we want


# Image Bot

When specific commands are typed in chat, the bot will send a related photo. This can start out as a simple algorithm but has great potential for expansion

- -brad will send a random photo of someone from brad's / a group pic
- -sbeve will send some random thing related to the server
- -nice will send a picture of mike or something else nice
- 

## Images from Reddit

- -boobs will send a random photo of boobs, randomly chosen from subreddits

This bot does NOT have music functionality, at least not currently. Other bots out there provide music services better than I could at the moment.
