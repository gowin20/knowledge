# Experimental Engagements

### College Scholars Requirement - June 26, 2020

## Research

Wanted to "dive deep into how machine learning works," then apply it to things like "a chess engine, a word creation algorithm (using my linguistic knowledge), and an art generator"

While I did not complete the specific projects I discussed back in August, my research still led me to create some amazing things.

this engagement inspired me to take Linguistics 185a in Winter Quarter, which is the first class on Computational Linguistics. This subject has amazingly useful applications for machine learning

- Using my knowledge from this class, I was able to make lots of useful linguistic programs. Most notably, I made an algorithm which generates grammatical sentences from a provided set of words. In addition to this, I made another algorithm which uses sentence parsing to check if a provided sentence is grammatical. These algorithms definitely aren't going to be used at Google or anything, but I'm very proud of them! My next step in this field is to deepen my knowledge of this by recreating the programs in Python, rather than Haskell. I will then be able to use data collection processes to provide the programs with a proper database of words.

In addition to researching Linguistics, I also attacked this engagement from another angle: Data Collection. Machine Learning is the process of training a program based off of a dataset which you provide it. This means that a core aspect of machine learning is obtaining datasets to train your algorithm with. I used Python's Beautiful Soup library to scrape data from webpages, as well as tons of different APIs in order to obtain information from the backend of websites. Through these data collection methods, I made several programs which analyze data and generate graphical representations. Finally, I later taught this practice to students in my capacity as an instructor at Juni Learning.

## Digital Media Practice

For this engagement, I wanted to "apply my knowledge of drawing up to this point to create good-looking 2d animations, and incorporate them into a new-and-improved version of my website"

To fulfill this engagement, I focused a large amount of energy towards creating a new-and-improved version of my website. That's where you're reading this now! While it looks simple at first glance, I ended up spending an impressive amount of time creating it - roughly equivalent to a part-time job for about 3 weeks. It went through many iterations before the one you see now. While I have made websites before, this is the most refined one by far, and the one which I'm the most proud of.

To clarify: I did not use a program like Squarespace or Wix to create this site. I didn't even rip other people's code off. Everything on this website was designed by me, and written by hand in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The process of creating this required proficiency in several different skills:

- Ability to write and understand HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- Ability to select good-looking color palates (seriously, I spent like half the time selecting colors for each individual page)
- Ability to create a good-looking site layout and theme
- Ability to plan site content, and gather pictures / writing to showcase

In addition to my website, I have also continued my passion for Digital Media in other ways. While I have not added any animations to my site yet, I am in the process of doing so. Most of my efforts have been in continuing to improve my Photoshop skills. One example piece is on the Art page.

Finally, I have ended up exploring Digital Media in a way which I was not expecting. I recently got a promotion at work, and have been selected to become one of Juni Learning's Blog Writers! This is super exciting, because I absolutely love to write! I'm ecstatic that the people at Juni recognized my passion. The blog can be found <a href="[https://junilearning.com/blog/](https://junilearning.com/blog/)">here</a>. I've written a few articles already, that are due to be published soon!

## Entrepreneurial / Financial Studies

My final Experimental Engagement did not go as sucessfully as the first two. While I pursued Financial Studies during my spring quarter, I ultimately did not find enough interest in the subject to continue learning about it.

My original goal for this engagement was not as concrete as the first two. I stated that "I know that I want to improve my networking skills, and apply them as much as possible in order to explore internship/job opportunities. I also stated that I wanted to learn more about how the economy works.

To pursue this engagement, I first began reading much more about the stock market and the state of the economy in general. When I returned home due to Coronavirus, I spoke at length with my father about my own family's financial situation, and he walked me through the system we have set up.

I figured that since I don't really have any experience in money-related fields, taking an introductory college course would be a great way to start off. Because of this, I enrolled in Economics 1 during week 3 of my Spring quarter.

At first, I did great in the class! All of the material was intuitive to me, and I even managed to get a perfect 100 on my first midterm. I like to plan ahead, so I even found myself considering a double major in Linguistics & Computer Science and Economics. This plan was especially tempting to me because Economics is one of the shortest majors at UCLA. According to my calculations I could add on the double major and still be on track to graduate in 4 years! I even went as far as planning out my course load with Nol.

However, during the second half of Spring Quarter (which should honestly be referred to as the "First Covid Quarter," things began to go downhill. I started to struggle with long bouts of sadness and depression, and my productivity began to decline sharply. I found that I was not motivated to continue doing work in my Economics class. Thinking more about it, I realized that Economics in general might just not be that appealing to me. I ended up dropping the class and abandoning my plans to double major, as there's no way I'm going to major in a subject which I'm not interested in.

Moving forward, I still feel as if it's necessary for me to have experience in the world of economics in order to pursue my dreams. My new plan is to aim for a minor in Entrepreneurship, which is similar to Economics but should be more up my alley.

This engagement goes to show a valuable lesson: The things you pursue sometimes don't turn out successfully, and that's okay. What's important is that I put in the effort.
