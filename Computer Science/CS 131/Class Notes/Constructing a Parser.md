# parser

- how can a parser do OR within CONCAT?
- parser must backtrack after it explores one part of an OR and finds it doesn't work
- so we pass an acceptor to a parser, to tell the parser if it needs to try again
- in the hint code, make_matcher's basic idea is to glue together little parsers to make big ones
    - *higher order functional programming*

- X | Y (match whatever X matches OR whatever Y matches)
    - assume you have a matcher for X and a matcher for Y
    - call make_matcher recursively in order to get a matcher for X and a matcher for Y
    - once you have these matchers, you need to glue them together into a bigger matcher

```ocaml
let or_func mX mY = (*matcher which matches either X or Y *)
	fun frag a -> match (mX frag a) with
		   | None -> mY frag a (* if x doesn't work, try Y *)
		   | Some mat -> Some mat (* if x does work, then just return what it returned *)
```

- concatenation: trying to match XY
    - assume we have a matcher for X and a matcher for Y
    - return what X matched, plus what Y matched, plus whatever didn't get matched as a suffix
    - fX is what x matched, fY is what Y matched
    - we return: $(fX) + (fY) + suffix$
    - $fX + (fY + suffix)$
        - woahhhhhhhhhh pretty  ðŸ’–
    - $(fY + suffix)$ treated as fX's suffix

```ocaml
let concat_func mX mY =
	fun frag a -> mX f (fun fY -> mY fY a) (* the acceptor is built just for this concatenation *)
```

- The parser which we made uses backtracking to try alternatives
    - naive type of parser, most parsers are smarter than this
    - expensive to backtrack a lot, worst case it loops forever or is exponential
- practical languages â†’ use a subset of context free grammars
    - develop fast parser that don't backtrack, for that subset
