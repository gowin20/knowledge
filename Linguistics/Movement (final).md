# Minimal Link Condition (MLC)

An element can only move to the closest viable landing site

- for a given type of movement, skipping over a potential landing site is not allowed

# Head Movement

### Potential Landing Sites

The closest c-commanding (upward) or c-commanded (downward) head

Every single phrase has a head, so we always know exactly where this will be

# A-Bar Movement

Movement to a position higher than the subject, usually Spec-CP

Seen in several constructions:

- Wh-movement (information questions)
- Relative clauses
- Topicalization
- Dislocation
- *tough* movement

### Potential Landing Sites

Every Spec-CP counts, whether occupied by some phrase or not!

See: Wh-islands

- C-heads define fundamental clause types: declarative vs interrogative, polar (yes/no) vs information, and many other stuff.
- C-heads, then, always care what goes into their Spec-CP

## Wh-Movement

We see so much shit here!

## Topicalization

## Left Dislocation

Very similar to Topicalization, but instead of there just being a trace gap where the phrase moved from there's a coreferenced pronoun

Not really seen in English!

### Hanging Topic Left Dislocation

- does NOT involve movement
- a pause after the initial constituent

> Matthiew, Marie lui plait

Matthew, Mary (him) pleases

- hard to tell if English has this. Something like "Anchovies, I like them!"

### Clitic Left Dislocation

clitic: a functional element that's phonologically dependent on other material

- DOES involve movement

## *tough* movement

> It is tough (for us) to work with Bill

> Bill is tough (for us) to work with __

Bill moves to the start of the sentence!

*difficult, easy, challenging, a bitch, etc all work*

[Bill] actually undergoes normal A movement to Spec-TP. However, the OP in the embedded clause undergoes A-bar movement!

[Bill] is [t] tough [OP [for [us] to work with [t]]]

# A Movement

Movement to s-structure subject + object positions

- Movement to Spec-TP
- Movement to Spec-AgrOP

Occurs in order to satisfy Case, as well as the EPP

Raising to Subject and Raising to Object: Inner subject/object raises to Spec-TP or Spec-AgrOP

### Potential Landing Sites

A-movement is always to a specifier position

Potential landing sites are **places where A-movement actually accomplishes something**: Satisfies the EPP or gets Case for a DP. Even if these places are already occupied!

Can't skip Spec-TPs, Spec-AgrOPs, but should be okay to skip auxiliary be/have

# *Tough* Movement
