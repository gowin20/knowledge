In addition to the EPP, there seems to be an additional requirement that a DP must move to exactly one of a special set of positions known as **Case Positions**

Languages with case morphology exhibit this behavior:

- subject of finite clause is nominative
- direct ovject of active transitive verb is accusative
- object of preposition is in one of various non-nominative cases
- specifier of possessive DP is genitive

English pronoun system has these same generalizations:

- I / *Me / *My like him
- She likes me / *I / *my
- She gave it to him / *he / *his
- This is my / *I / *me book

Hypothesis:
A DP must have found itself in a case position **by s-structure** in order to be happy

### The Case Filter: Each DP must receive exactly one Case by s-structure

What does it mean to "receive a case?"

- it happens when the DP has been in one of the designated Case positions

**Filter**: a condition such that if it's not satisfied, the representation is ungrammatical. "filters out" invalid sentences

### Case Positions in English

1. Subject position: **spec of finite TP** (NOT nonfinite TP)
    - non finite TP positions are "to ...."
2. Object Case position of a transitive V: **Spec of XP** (NOT complement of V!)
3. **Complement of P**
4. **Spec-DP when D is an apostrophe** ('s) - a possessor or genitive position
5. Spec of **infinitival TP**, when that TP is **complement to the complementizer *for***

    > [For John to leave] would upset Mary.

6. The **second object position** of a double object verb

    > I gave Mary money.         I sent Chris flowers.

    - in a double object verb, the first object (usually the agent) is gonna move up to Spec AgrIOP
    - second object (if it is a DP) is gonna move up to Spec AgrOP
        - if not a DP, no movement for second object

**Corollary:** Movement of a DP from a Case position to another Case position is ruled out!

> *John seems [that *t* is happy].

> *I believe Mary [that *t* is happy].

- no problem when you move to a non-Case position!
- A-bar movment is NEVER to a Case position, so it can always follow this A-movement

### DPs which don't need to satisfy the Case Filter

1. PRO
    - it wants to be in Spec of a NON-finite TP
2. Things that look like DPs but are not arguments
    - these function adverbially instead - motify verbs
    - plausibly analyzed as complements of a silent P

    > John left for Moscow last week

    > Sue does field work many places in Africa

3. DPs functioning as predicates
    - nonreferential and describing properties of other DPs

    > We elected Chris mayor

    > I consider that guy a stable geni

## Places where Case is not available

- non finite TP positions
- when sentence is passive, AgrOP Spec

### Case for Wh-movement DPs

DPs which undergo Wh-movement still need to satisfy the Case Filter, which means they must first move to a Case position before moving up to Spec-CP

- includes DP null operators!

- "him" is not getting Case in Spec Agr OP, needs to move all the way up to TP of the whole sentence to get Case
- passive verb "considered" does not give Case in the Spec Agr OP
