# vPs and AgrOPs

- unergative verbs

![[diff types of vPs and AgrOPs/Untitled.png]]

### CAUS

- combines with verbs to form verbs
- some event E2 causes event E1 to happen
- two types of CAUS. one introduces an extra argument (found in active clauses), one does not (passive)
- CAUS(act) and CAUS(pass)

![[Decomposing Predicates, VP Shells/Untitled.png]]

We then form the verb by combining its two morphemes. The A head raises to the V head

![[Decomposing Predicates, VP Shells/Untitled 1.png]]

CAUS can also combine with intransitive verbs in order to form transitive verbs

- **causative-inchoative alternations**

![[Decomposing Predicates, VP Shells/Untitled 2.png]]

- note that DP [the wood] is a complement to morpheme *burn* in both inchoative and causative structures
- inchoative is **unaccusative**, an internal argument raises to Spec-TP
- CAUS means "cause to"
- burn means "become burned", melt means "become melted", etc

The flames burned the wood → "The flames caused the wood to become burned"

**CAUS and other morphemes like it are given the category (little V) - v - as the head of a vP**

In Wolof (senegal), CAUS is actually an overt morpheme! Lots of evidence for it

> -ify

Verb morpheme, means "become"

![[Decomposing Predicates, VP Shells/Untitled 4.png]]

> -en

means "to become Adj", very similar to -ify

We also have a SILENT suffix that carries the same meaning as -en and -ify!

Convention is to use BECOM

### BECOM

- Combines with adjectives to form verbs
- "becomes adjective"
- doesn't assign any theta roles, or introduce any arguments
- silent

![[Decomposing Predicates, VP Shells/Untitled 5.png]]

- ISAT suggests that silent BECOM, unlike overt counterparts such as -ify,-en, etc., cannot combine with adjectives that describe open-ended scalar properites: something that is wet can always become more wet, but something that is dry cannot become more dry once it is totally dry.

### Examples

- most commonly, if breakdown of verb is not given, it's going to be just the **verb + CAUS**

`Mary broke the glass`

![[diff types of vPs and AgrOPs/Untitled 1.png]]

- **with no object, Arg just has a null head**

`The children argued for an hour`

![[diff types of vPs and AgrOPs/Untitled 2.png]]

- **with both CAUS and BECOM**

`I will open the door`

![[diff types of vPs and AgrOPs/Untitled 3.png]]

`The homework is always graded by Tom`

`Hugo will bake cupcakes for the party`

# vPs and AgrIOPs and AgrOPs

- we have two Agrs when we have a ternary structure: a verb with two complements
- order goes: vP, AgrIOP, vP, AgrOP
- first complement starts in second vP, moves up to SPEC AgrIOP
- second complement starts as complement to the verb all the way at the bottom, moves up to SPEC AgrOP

### RECIP

- we need to add a new head: RECIP → when the person is recipient of something, eg giving someone a book, or telling someone a secret
    - in conjunction w this, the verb turns into GO POSS → change of possession, or GO INFO POSS → change of possession of information

    `I told John quietly a secret`

![[diff types of vPs and AgrOPs/Untitled 6.png]]

- second object moves up to SPEC AgrOP still
- first object (agent) starts in the smaller vP, and moves up to AgrIOP (indirect object) SPEC
- this is all because the second DP needs Case, gets it from the Agr SPEC

### Example - EXPER

`I showed no child his baby pictures`

![[diff types of vPs and AgrOPs/Untitled 7.png]]

- instead of RECIP and GO POSS, here we have EXPER and visible as the Verb head
- same thing, different names

### Second Obj is not DP

- no movement! does not need to move upwards to get Case

`I told John quietly that I quit my job`

![[diff types of vPs and AgrOPs/Untitled 8.png]]

- that CP [that I quit my job] does not move anywhere, stays as complement of V
- the CP has the regular structure of just the verb + CAUS

# no vPs / AgrOps

- unaccusative verbs do not have this structure
