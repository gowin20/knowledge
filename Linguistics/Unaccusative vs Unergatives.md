# Intransitive Verbs

Intransitive verbs do not allow direct objects. These are verbs WITHOUT complements completely!

### Internal vs External

Originally, we thought that Internal arguments were complement of V, and External were specifier of V. however, it's a little bit more complicated now

External and internal arguments originate in separate zones:

- Internal arguments can never move higher than AgrOP if AgrOP has case available in its Spec
- External arguments originate in Spec-vP now, and live their whole life higher than AgrOP in the "external argument zones"

Only arguments introduced by little v's originate in the external argument zones

**Low Zone:** AgrOP and below, where internal arguments originate

**High Zone:** Above AgrOP, where external arguments originate

No longer a distinction between specifier and complement: low zone stuff could originate in spec-AP/VP, or complement of AP/VP. Sometimes actually impossible to figure out! No detectable difference

## Unaccusative Verbs

**Low Zone**

- Verbs whose grammatical subject is not a semantic agent
- the subject of these verbs is semantically similar to the complement of transitive verbs
- no vP or AgrOP layers!

> the tree fell

this is something that happened to the subject, rather than something initiated by it. "tree" plays a similar role here as it does as an object in a transitive sentence, such as "they cut down the tree"

### Subclasses of Unaccusatives

**Change of State**

- Freeze/Melt/Break

**Change of Position**

- bounce/move/roll/rotate/spin/swing

**Stative Verbs**

- 

**Verbs of existence and (dis)appearance**

- 

**Inherently Directed Motion**

- come, go, fall

## Unergative Verbs

**High Zone**

- it has JUST an agent argument. subject is always an agent or some sort of initiator to the event!
- able to take some external arguments such as CAUS

words like talk, run, resign, argue

# Testing for Unaccusative vs Unergative

- no one test that will give you the answer
- lots of subclasses of unaccusatives and unergatives

### 1. Resultative Secondary Predication Test

1. Possible for some DPs that are:
    - subjects of unaccusatives
    - subjects of passives
    - direct objects of transitives
2. Impossible for all DPs that are
    - subjects of unergatives
    - subjects of transitives

**Basically: possible only for DPs that were in the low zone at D-Structure**

**Resultative:** Has to describe the state of the relevant DP that results from the main event from the clause - something directly caused by the clause

If it describes something that's constant throughout the event, then it's a **depictive**, and this is pointless

- The river froze solid
- The gate swung shut
- The bottle broke open
- The table was wiped clean
- The house was painted white
- Mary broke the bottle open
- The wind swung the gate shut
- The server wiped the table clean

[these are depictives, not resultatives]

*Dora shouted hoarse

*The jogger ran sore

*You can't swim sober

Works for unaccusatives that describe changes of state/position

Doesn't work for the other three subclasses:

- statives like *remain*
- verbs of *existence and disaappearance*
- inherently directed motion like *come, go, fall*

### 2. Causative Alternation

- most unergatives cannot be made into a transitive
- but unaccusatives can

```jsx
The ball bounced. -> The kid bounced the ball
The ice melted. -> John melted the ice
* The teachers played the children 
* The comedians laughed the crowd 
```

- if something can be made into a transitive, it is likely a unaccusative then
- some unergatives LOOK like they can be made into transitives

```jsx
the soldier marched to the tent -> the general marched the soldiers to the tent 
```

- but these are a bit different than the ones that work above
    - the subject of the transitive for unergatives must be an actual agent, you can't say "the lightning jumped the horse over the fence"
    - they sound pretty weird when the PP complement is taken out â†’ the general marched the soldiers, the trainer jumped the horse, etc

### 3. Appearance in a particular *there* construction where PP is complement

- some unaccusatives can form a particular construction: [There V NP PP]

```jsx
There emerged a creepy creature from the swamp. 
There arrived a woman at the train station. 

* There dove a guy into a pool. 
* There jumped a rescuer into the water. 
```

### 4. Adjectival perfect participles

- some unaccusatives can take a adjectival perfect participle

```jsx
a broken glass
a rotated image
a vanished civilization 

* a jogged athlete
* a sung performer 
```

### 5. -er

- unergatives can have -er added to the verb, not all unaccusatives can

```jsx
a dancer, jogger, runner, singer, etc
* a remainer, emerger, appearer, etc
```

- but be careful because some unaccusatives can do this too

```jsx
a freezer, a melter, a roller, a swinger
```
