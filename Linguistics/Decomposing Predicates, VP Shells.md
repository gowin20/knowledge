# Decomposing Predicates, VP Shells

Much of the time, we want to decompose the meaning of predicates into their component morphemes and associate syntactic structure with them

- the "word" level is somewhat arbitrary; let's focus on morphemes instead!

Check this out:

- Adjective *wet* takes 1 argument, a Theme
- Verb *wet* takes 2 arguments, a Causer / Agent and a Theme
- in both cases, the THEME is the actual thing which is wet

> 1. The wet towel

> 2. They wet(ted) the towel

This is the same word! but one is an adjective, one is a verb

(2) should be built from the same underlying AP as (1), but should contain multiple morphemes since it takes more arguments

- add a Verb component that's phonologically empty, whose meaning involves causation
- convention: **CAUS** morpheme

# CAUS

- combines with verbs to form verbs
- some event E2 causes event E1 to happen
- two types of CAUS. one introduces an extra argument (found in active clauses), one does not (passive)
- CAUS(act) and CAUS(pass)

We then form the verb by combining its two morphemes. The A head raises to the V head

CAUS can also combine with intransitive verbs in order to form transitive verbs

- **causative-inchoative alternations**

- note that DP [the wood] is a complement to morpheme *burn* in both inchoative and causative structures
- inchoative is **unaccusative**, an internal argument raises to Spec-TP
- CAUS means "cause to"
- burn means "become burned", melt means "become melted", etc

The flames burned the wood â†’ "The flames caused the wood to become burned"

**CAUS and other morphemes like it are given the category (little V) - v - as the head of a vP**

In Wolof (senegal), CAUS is actually an overt morpheme! Lots of evidence for it

> -ify

Verb morpheme, means "become"

> -en

means "to become Adj", very similar to -ify

We also have a SILENT suffix that carries the same meaning as -en and -ify!

Convention is to use BECOM

# **BECOM**

- Combines with adjectives to form verbs
- "becomes adjective"
- doesn't assign any theta roles, or introduce any arguments
- silent

- ISAT suggests that silent BECOM, unlike overt counterparts such as -ify,-en, etc., cannot combine with adjectives that describe open-ended scalar properites: something that is wet can always become more wet, but something that is dry cannot become more dry once it is totally dry.

Small leap of faith: let's assume that **all active verbs with an Agent, Cause, or Experiencer subject contain at least one little v(P) above their root VP/AP**

## Passivization

In English, Passivization applies to a verb that takes an external and at least one internal argument

1. prevents the external argument from being expressed as a DP in "Spec-vP"
2. removes the verb's ability to assign object Case
3. requires the verb's VP/vP to be the complement of auxiliary *be*
4. requires the verb to be inflected as a passive participle
5. allows an optional by-PP adjunct to the main VP, in which the DP complement of by plays the role of external argument

ArrOP

# Little v

A derivational affix that creates a verb, and heads a phrase in the syntactic structure

- at S-structure, the head of every vP must contain a verb or trace of a verb
- behave like VP: complements to auxiliary Vs, undergo VP ellipsis, AdvP adjunction, etc

**Little vs that assign external theta roles, and ONLY those little vs, give case to the specifier of their complement (Spec-AgrOP)**

CAUS(act) assigns an external theta role. therefore, "She dried this thing" has the following tree

the empty AgrO head MUST actually be in the derived verbal complex [dry BECOM CAUS -ed] - just not shown here for sanity
