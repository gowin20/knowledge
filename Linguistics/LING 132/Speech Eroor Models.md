### Fromkin's Model
Serial / Stagged model
- temporally ordered processing
- discrete stages of speech processing
- one happens after the next
- unidirectional, goes from message formulation -> phonology

downside: requires a separate method to account for the "lexical bias" effect

**lexical bias:** speech errors are more likely to result in words than not words

#### Process of Speech according to Fromkin
1. Generate meaning
2. Form syntax
3. Determine intonation contour
4. Insert content words
5. Phonetic Segments
6. Produce Speech
7. Monitor Utterance with editor


### Dell's Model
Parallel Model
- everything can happen at once
- bidirectional: bottom up and top down, goes from phonemes to syntax and vice versa
- explains lexical bias without any additional mechanisms

What stages intuitively go into speech perception?




### Our Model: Stages of speech production
1. Conceptualization
2. Formulation
3. Execution
4. Monitoring




# Our Intuitive model of speech perception
Not of production, which is what Fromkin and Dell address

1. Hear the sentence
2. Parse sounds, categorize them in some way
3. Connect sounds to existing words in lexicon
4. Syntactic analysis
5. Access semantic meaning

General Process:

**Stage 1:** Listener hears sounds, categorizes them according to their acoustic phonetic properties, and orders them into a string

**Stage 2:** Listener takes the string and matches it with a words in their mental lexicon, recalling the word
