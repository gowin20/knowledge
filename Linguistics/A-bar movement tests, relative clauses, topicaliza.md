### A-bar Movement

- many phrases can undergo: DP, PP, AP, AdvP, etc
- movement to position higher than subject position, eg, SPEC CP
- we have seen this in questions and relative clauses
    - have been calling this *wh movement*

Seen in:

- Interrogative (wh-) questions
- Relative Clauses
- Topicalization
- Left Dislocation
- *tough* movement

### Properties of A-bar movement

- it leaves a gap
- the distance between its S and D structure positions can be as big as you want
- must obey subjacency
- must obey comp trace effects
- must obey strong cross over effects

# Tests for A-bar movement

- **Strong Crossover:**
    - wh phrase moves over a co-indexed pronoun which the wh-phrase binds

    `* Who(i) does he(i) think is clever?` ****

- **Weak Crossover:**
    - wh phrase moves over a c-commandinng phrase, that contains a pronoun that the wh-phrase binds

    `* Who(i) does [his(i) brother] think is clever?`

- **Adjunct Island Condition:**
    - a wh phrase cannot move out of a CP within an adjunct

    `* What did he go home [before [Mary finished ~~what~~]]?`

- **Subject Condition**
    - a wh phrase cannot move out of a DP in Spec TP

    `* Which students did [a picture of ~~which students~~] appear in the newspaper?`

- **Coordinate Structure Constraint**
    - a wh phrase cannot move out of a conjunct

    `* what did you eat some pie and drink ~~what~~ ?`

- **Wh Island Constraint**
    - a wh phrase cannot move out of a CP that has a wh phrase as its SPEC

    `* who did you ask [why the police arrested ~~who~~ ~~why~~]`

- **Complex NP Constraint**
    - a wh phrase cannot move out of a CP that is **complement to N**

    `What did you hear the [rumour [CP ~~what~~ that Bill ate ~~what]]?~~`

- **Sentential Subject Constraint**
    - a wh phrase cannot move out of a CP in SPEC TP

    `*What did [CP that you visited ~~what~~] annoy me?`

- **Left Branch Constraint**
    - a wh phrase cannot move out of the specifier of a DP

    `*Whose are you eating cake?`

- **Comp Trace Effects**
    - you cannot have a complementizer followed by a wh word or a trace of one

    `Who do you think that ~~who~~ met Sue?`

# Relative Clauses

- **CP that is adjoined to a NP**

![[A-bar movement tests, relative clauses, topicaliza/Untitled.png]]

- the NP that a relative clause is adjoined to is called the head
- this is called a restrictive relative clause, the meaning is that the unique individual who x such that x is a man, I introduced you to
- restrive clause example:

`The woman, who I think will be president one day, is extremely ambitious.`

- this means the unique woman who I am talking about is very ambitious, and also, i think she will be president one day
- this does NOT mean that the woman such that I think the woman will be president one day, is ambitious
- these non restrictive clauses probably adjoin higher than NP

### restrictive relative clauses and wh movement

- restrictive relative clauses:
    - TP in the relative clause contains a gap
    - can be unbounded
    - subject to subjacency, comp trace, and strong crossover
- so, it seems that relative clauses allow A-bar, or wh, movement
- there are some clauses that don't have a wh word, but still act in the same way

`I noticed the man ____ you saw in the park`

- gap after man, before you
- instead of having a wh word there, we put a silent operator OP
- non restrictive clauses are not possible with silent operators
- **doubly filled comp filter:**
    - you cannot have a wh phrase followed by that
    - you can, however, have OP followed by that
    - `* this is the man who that mary visited`
    - gotta pick one or the other between who and that

### promotion / head raising of relative clauses

- the head of the relative clause originates inside the RC, then moves out

`The headway which John has made`

![[A-bar movement tests, relative clauses, topicaliza/Untitled 1.png]]

- starts as "John has made which headway"
    - *which headway* moves to SPEC CP, normal stuff, and then *headway* moves out of it and up, leaving *which*
- this only seems to work with idioms where the meaning can kind of be derived from the words, other things like "kick the bucket" have absolutely nothing to do w the meaning and don't make sense in this head raising context

# Topicalization

 `Pizza, I like ~~pizza~~`

`Star Wars, I watched ~~Star Wars~~ often`

- does not have to be a wh word for this to be A bar movement

the linear order suggests that SPEC CP is not the landing place

- so the traditional landing site is adjoined to TP, this is what we will adopt

![[A-bar movement tests, relative clauses, topicaliza/Untitled 2.png]]

- we know this is A bar movement because it obeys island constraints, is unbounded, and obeys subjacency and crossover effects

# Left Dislocation

- like topicalization except there is a coreferential pronoun instead of a gap

`Star Wars, I watch it often`

- two types
    - *HTLD: Hanging Topic Left Dislocation*
        - no gap, no movement
        - intonation break after initial constiuent
        - English may have them, hard to tell

        `Anchovies(i), I like them (i)`

        ![[A-bar movement tests, relative clauses, topicaliza/Untitled 3.png]]

        - structure: hanging topic is just tacked on somewhere at the left edge of the clause, here it's in a random CP adjunct

        ![[A-bar movement tests, relative clauses, topicaliza/Untitled 4.png]]

    - *CLLD: Clitic Left Dislocation*
        - Clitic: a functional element that is phonologically dependent on other material, eg "John's" or "doesn't"
        - does involve movement
        - no intonation break after initial constiuent

        ![[A-bar movement tests, relative clauses, topicaliza/Untitled 5.png]]

        - we didn't specify a structure for this kind

# Tough Movement

`It is tough to work with Bill`

`Bill is tough to work with`

- other predicates behave like this: tough, easy, a bitch, difficult
- doesn't seem likely to be A bar movement

`Bill is tough for us to work with`

![[A-bar movement tests, relative clauses, topicaliza/Untitled 6.png]]

- Bill originates high up, then moves up
    - this is normal Spec to SPEC TP movement
- OP originates lower and moves up, co-indexed with Bill
    - Here, we have A bar movement of OP
- this might be too simple
    - Bill only gets one theta role in “It is tough for us to work with Bill” -> the role being “the object of work with”
    - but it seems like here, there are two roles given to Bill ??
        - there’s one from the trace down below, where OP originates from,[it is tough to work with TRACE], which is co-indexed w Bill
        - and then there’s the second trace, where “Bill” originates from
- a variant of the *tough* movement structure
    - `Bill is an easy person to work with`
        - so now “an easy person” is now a DP
        - you can’t say this another way, so its not like there are two ways w the same meaning as we saw w the *tough* movement
        - BUT you can have `Bill is a person who is easy to work with`
            - the fact that this works means that maybe, Bill is not the subject of the sentence that relates to “easy”, or “tough”, but rather there is another predicate that is being hidden -> eg, `Bill is (someone) who is easy to work with`
