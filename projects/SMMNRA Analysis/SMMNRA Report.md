Time: Noon, remains constant. for consistency, no daylight savings time was used as we are measuring only solar time

to calculate solar position, a lat/long located in Agoura Hills, near the center of the study area, was used:
34°08'36.4"N 118°47'12.1"W

Solar Irradiance:
$$
I = S * Hillshade / 254
$$
(254 instead of 255 as the ArcGIS hillshade begins at 0)


~34.1203° N
1360.8 +- 0.0005 W/m^2

solar constant estimates, based on the graph provided on the assignment doc:
- March 20th: 350 W/m^2
- June 20th: 450 W/m^2
- September 22nd: 375 W/m^2
- December 21st: 150 W/m^2


on the maps, all colors are scaled relative to the maximum value across all four: 450 w/m^2
