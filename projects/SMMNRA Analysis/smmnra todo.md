#SMMNRA 
steps:
- [x] set up data
- [x] slope map
- [x] aspect map
- [x] dem hillshade map
- [x] overview map
- [x] seasonal insolation maps 
	- [x] normalize each hillshade
	- [x] blocked: get accurate estimations for each solar radiation constant
	- [x] use w/ raster calculator to create maps 4-7
	- [x] use raster calculator to add each raster together and divide by 4, for map 8
- [x] vegetation table (using zonal tools):
	- [x] elevation
	- [x] slope
	- [x] aspect
	- [x] table joins for these
	- [x] solar regime in W/m^2 for summer
	- [x] table joins to calculate it all together?
- [ ] report
	- [ ] 1 page writing
		- [ ] intro
		- [ ] methods / writeup of process (not at arcgis level, but conceptually)
		- [ ] interpretation of results
	- [x] cover page
	- [ ] appendix
		- [x] maps
		- [x] table(s)
		- [ ] information on data points used for seasonal insolation maps

- [ ] fix maps / reproject
- [ ] combine into pdf
