(Verse)
we pull spooks in the coup, we got witches to scoot with
mobbin with the ghouls, Casper's startin disputes with

heroin and absinthe, the pauper fool's kiss
beyond the abyss softens to pure bliss

worry not; hit my ouija board I'll see you often
put flower on my grave and we'll hotbox the coffin

yeah we stay puft with no one to bust us




blow
crow
show

(Hook)
I been haunted by the homies

 I go down 
 to the underground
 beyond __
 
 
 
 








this sacred ritual must be done at night
with the proper sacraments anointed right
ten pounds of weed, and a barrel of booze
form his body and blood as part of righteous dues
then in a cloud of smoke, at last he'll appear
the homie returns, sparking joy and fear

*spooky noises*










fresh to death

roll with casper and the ghouls

hotbox the coffin at my funeral rager




pull up to the wake and hotbox the coffin



suicide doors on the hearse




if you wanna see me then you're gonna have to urn it
like, call an undertaker then go buy that shit
burn me up, cool it down, scrape my ashes off the floor
leave me scattered on the field like if Biden went to war


no we ain't your friend, 
dadad adada dada we'll knock you out for weeks


hit my oujia board 
fresh to death the way i'm dressin
he's my new favorite possession



behind all death there's a silver side
eternal liberty in how homies ride







fresh to death the way I'm dressin
I'll keep you in a fine possession

Whenever 







Caesar Agustus


Thinkin bout a time
when my friend was alive
always catch a vibe
never take back ties
see him everywhere,
he won't catch my eye
I'm haunted, by, the homies





been haunted by the homie
i've 






i'm not like other guys - i'm dead - so babe you'll have to urn it





cover yo shit in ectoplasm

haunt yo bedside table, my favorite one-night stand


we yo family, and family by your side

always possess the homies cause they can't talk to girls

he my latest acquisition




funeral rager
rager at the cemetary
some flower on my grave, we'll hotbox the coffin
yeah we stay puft, with no one to bust us


yeah the homie's gone, but he lives on. in our hearts and as a ghoul


light the sacred flames to bring him back to life


the necromancer, bestows eternal life upon fallen homies

what lies beyond may be unknown, but homies never falter
