location: young hall, roof and inside

stalker lives on roof, fixated upon a guy (gay)
uses that musty fuckin cleaning room to clean
torture room as well

kidnaps guy?
somehow imprisons him in that torture room, either against his will or according to it

gets justice in the end, in some form!


harold
frank



leaves a trail of love letters up to the roof - starting with one that falls through the window

male scientist journeys up, all the way to the far back home of the man in the pipes

upon his arrival, NOT allowed to leave. promptly imprisoned there
he's the only one who can go inside and everything, so nobody will ever come rescue

ends with the door closing

perspective of the scientist, or of the rooftop man?

advantages of daniel's perspective:
- mysterious, unknown
- scary elements
- sympathetic protagonist


maybe he's not imprisoned at all. maybe the whole vibe is that, and Frank keeps ominously asking to stay

in the end, he can't stay in Frank's world. they're too fundamentally different to ever coexist, and Frank was deluded for thinking otherwise

some people are meant to watch from the outside. This is due to the way our society is structured

frank has a mental breakdown when daniel tries to leave. 





heartbreakingly lonely
accentuate the height

hero's journey of daniel
ominous and foreboding, until you get inside of frank's home
even the space is scary honestly

writing love letters

# FRANK
lives on the roof, in the back area
responsible for maintaining the ecosystem

profoundly lonely, enamored by a male scientist he sees inside

deluded. thinks their worlds are compatible enough to be together
he can't ever leave the machines. He's responsible for powering the whole thing
- establishing shot of him crawling around maintaining everything
