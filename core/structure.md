top-level categories of folder:

- [[people]]
- [[worlds]]
- [[()]]
- [[useful in life]]
- [[knowledge-fun]]




folders may contain actual skeletal structures, but they can also be associated by type with no connecting nodes. People show up in all aspects of life, as do places and concepts



Fundamentally, two reasons to link folders:

to show heirarchy and structure
to draw meaningful relationships between fields
we need to use both, but we should differentiate "structuring" notes from "connecting" notes.

These structure notes serve to link high-level concepts together, existing on a metalevel above the connection graph. I mean there could be arbitrary levels of that


STRUCTURE NOTES MUST OBEY A STRICT HEIRARCHY. They need to be VIEWABLE AND INTUITIVE FOR HUMANS, and NOT CLUTTER THE NOTES

No such restriction exists on note connections

Update: i found that they were cluttering the actual ideas within the notes. I've decided to migrate structure, like truly high-level concepts, to tags.
