I certainly value the ability to complete work across multiple devices. When I remain sitting in the same place, it's hard for me to transition between tasks effectively. Changing my location helps immensely. When I use any app, I want it to work on my desktop, laptop, and phone. If it doesn't work across all, I'm not going to use it nearly as much.

If I had to pick a platform I used the most, it would still be my phone. However, I believe that I'm much closer to 50/50 than most users. I get so, so many hours of screentime each day from my computers. 

Actually, fuck! I've DEFINITELY used my computers more than my phone today. I guess it depends on what I do on a day, and whether I'm at home.

I'll have to rethink the numbers now. From 2018-2020, it's phone. In my life overall, it might be computer still! Although I used my phone a ton in high school, I did the same with my computer.

It doesn't really matter. I need apps on them both.
