My system for productivity utilizes both Notion and Obsidian to their strengths:

Notion: a META TOOL for LIVING MY LIFE
- Life stuff
- Productivity
- Journaling
- Basically "me", and lots of things. This is my primary thing

Obsidian: a LEARNING TOOL
Obsidian is meant for learning, and whenever I'm parsing new information - be it from school, online articles, or from hearing someone speak IRL - it will live in Obsidian. I'll migrate all of my physical class notes here too :)

Evergreen knowledge repository that will give back its entire life. just need to make sure [[upkeep]] isn't too high.

I've been a student for so long that it's hard for me to disguinguish learning from living. There's really no difference to be honest. I'm constantly learning as I live, and that won't stop. I'll still be learning every day, and Notion will likely show that growth. Obsidian is for beautiful, comprehensive, evergreen notes meant to be used as a reference for years to come! It's what is going to give me a huge leg up on everyone else in life :)
