just talked to athya

had a fucking FANTASTIC TIME hanging out with Josh and Coco. I really like BOTH of them, as well as Kristin! it's such a vibe at that apartment, I feel so fortunate to be growing closer to them right now because otherwise I'd be pretty completely alone haha. Tomorrow will be another day of working out in the morning, doing something PRODUCTIVE VIBES during the day, and hanging out at night once josh is off work. Maybe I can hang out w/ coco or kristin during the day who knows

I just wish i could fuck someone! literally anyone. I'm so horny right now and Shreya isn't here

I still feel distant from Shreya. I'm at a weird point where I'm REALLY FUCKING UNSURE about our relationship. Which way should it go? do we need to stay together? do we need to break up? I'm overwhelmed by both thoughts, and don't know what to do.

also, athya is like so attractive wow. Her hair is cool, and I couldn't stop looking at her shoulders during the call lol

No matter what happens, I won't become anything like Ethan. He's womanizing and generally attracted to bad situations. I think he knows what he's doing. He's a smart little guy
