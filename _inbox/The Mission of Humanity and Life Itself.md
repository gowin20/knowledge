I know I can have some trouble writing, especially when I'm high. But I invoke my muse to spur my thoughts onto the paper tonight! Channel the being in the moment, the feeling of true connection from your mid to the keyboard. Let words flow freely, as if you've opened the faucet to your brain. This is word vomit, this is thinking without writing - writing without thinking. It's basiclaly the same thing, but you're externalizing your thoughts in the lateter by connecting them onto the paper - kinda like transferring your conciousness into your fingertips. That's what I'll do


I was thinking tonight about whether or not it's good to stay with Shreya. I want to write frankly without auditing, as this will never be seen by anyone except me. I love Shreya so much but it's hard sometimes, and it definitely is reason to at least explore this path. I don't want her to ever see this - far too hurtful. When presenting sensitive topics to others, it's good to audit yourself in some way - my thoughts right now are incoherent and all over the place, and i'm fundamentally unable to control them or audit. If this is word vomit, I can't choose what color the vomit is. However, I can return to the puddle later on in order to pick out the particuraly nasty chunks of viscera. Editing is crucial in proper communication - refining thoughts so they are communicated adequately, as a thought object is impossible to fully express in words. Language is effective at communicating essentials - such as how to stay alive, etc, but doesn't really allow others to fully explore and understand the intricate ways in which one's brain process experiences and thinks. The closest we can come to something like that is sharing genuine moments with other people, where you now your thoughts are functionally exactly the same.

That's something I love about Shreya - we've had SO MANY of those genuine moments! In an intensely intimate way, I believe that Shreya and I think very very similarly. I'm not sure why it's come about that way - even though we come from different backgrounds, we have so much in common in the way that we process reality.

At least, I hope so. I guess I can never be certain if we truly experience moments in the same way. I think I should be realistic, and assume that that's actually not the case.

I know that our brains do many things differently. I'm extremely spatially oriented, and I don't think Shreya's brain functions in the same way at all. That probably has a LARGE amount of influence on how I fundamentally structure my thoughts, and may be a way in which communication frequently lapses between us. However, I know for a fact that Shreya is incredibly observant, just like me. I want to be a true experiencer of the world. I want to see things for their full, remarkable beauty and uniqueness.



My recent acid trip epitomized this - back in September 2020. I saw the world with open eyes, and I saw what my future could be. Trees swirling languidly in abstract, with each individual leaf possessing a myriad of colors and patterns when focused upon. Even when viewing the sidewalk, each miniscule imperfection from the turbulent flow of wet concrete came back to life, illuminating the cold panels. This was one of the most remarkable experiences of my life, and it's something which I don't think many people fully understand. Seeing the world, truly observing how beautiful everything around you is and appreciating it all with the full sense of wonder and amazement it deserves, is my truest goal in life. 
Is it possible with, a sufficient amount of experience, to regain the wonder and amazement possessed by children viewing the world for the first time? Perhaps the word "regain" is too pessimistic to begin with - I don't think that I've ever truly lost my sense of awe at how amazing the world can be.

This is the tragedy of the artist. Life is the most amazing thing to ever be created. I truly believe that, and that none of us humans will ever surpass the fucking incredible invention that is life itself. Everything about life, small and large, truly deserves to be observed with amazement. However, in order to survive and navigate life - to become a part of life itself - one must intentionally numb themselves to the world.

Human society is a construct built upon suffering, fundamentally.

All aspects of it. Not suffering in the sense of "actively being tortured", but merely the notion that our entire concept of the world is built upon fundamental truths which no other animal adheres to.

Actually, maybe every other animal adheres to them!

A true observer, and appreciator of the world, will be one that is entirely removed.
If something like "life" is watching us out there, in higher dimensions or simply from afar, they would be able to view humanity with such a true sense of wonderment. An observer like that wouldn't be bogged down by other things, which take time away from full comprehension. This **"ideal observer"** would be able to devote their entire existence simply to observation.

Humans aren't categorized well - maybe higher-dimensional creatures have an entire brain like a human does, able to act as an ideal observer. This then feeds back to a centralized network of other brains, with others able to hoist the brunt of responsibility for staying alive and other such menial tasks.

Holy shit. That's what humanity is becoming!

We're witnessing the birth of a higher-dimensional entity. Something beyond the human, never before seen but constructed from the building blocks of life.

Humanity as a whole can be thought of as a single individual. What would that person be like? The person who is made up of every other human on the planet. Maybe you'd stuff them all into some sort of suit, to create one giant giga-human with all the people inside. That's pretty stupid actually - I don't think there'd be any way for this giga-human to appear anything like a normal human being. This gal would have a nebulous shape, something we normal humans struggle with comprehending. We're made to see little things, so it's hard for us to imagine a single entity which is basically a massive swarm. We already think of bees like this - in video games, it's common to have "swarm of bees" enemies with a single hitbar which are comprised of thousands of little friends. It's time for us to conceptualize humans like that as well.

So let's think of people like that. Honestly, in my mind I've always found it easiest to visualize the entire earth when I'm thinking of it, with all the little humans on it forming the giga-human on the surface. In actuality, our ecosystem and society isn't just about humans - it should be ALL of earth's living creatures and perhaps also inanimate properties such as minerals and the earth's mass itself. In reality, there isn't a good "level of distinction" for interesting stuff in the universe beyond "matter" and "not matter" - their interplay creates all of the beauty in the world. My point is, this high-level entity I'm conceiving of isn't just made of humans. It's everything. The entire world, all of Earth, is a single entity. We are God.

God's entity is comprised of all of us, and everything on the earth. Xis structure is composed of rocks and earth, with complicated dynamics supporting the lifeblood of the entity on the surface of the planet. This is where everything relevant to xis life and propogation lives. Xis skin comprised of forests, trees, and plants made to support animals and provide them with oxygen and food. Animals running through xis veins like little red blood cells, literally forming the lifeblood of this entity. 
Humans have an extremely special role in this entity's ecosystem as well. We sit at the top of the food chain, and as such occupy the mantle of society. We're part of a living, vibrant body, and occupy the place of the brain. WE ARE THE BRAIN OF GOD.

We're in charge, baby. Humans have established such complete control over the surface of the world's crust, where all real complexity lies on earth (as far as we know there isn't much of interest in the mantle and core, they just exist and need to be really fucking large to support complex patterns). We're in charge, and although nobody really "consented" to putting us in charge, it's the byproduct of how evolution works. Evolution as a system fundamentally doesn't adhere to human societal structure, it's just concerned with producing optimal results. Perhaps evolution exists solely to create xis body. 
	even personifying this entity with pronouns feels weird. I need to think more on that

Anyways, i guess my point is that we're the people in the driver's seat for all of this stuff. Big-picture, Humanity has shouldered the responsibility for caring for all of life, and indeed this entire planet. That seems like a big burden to bear, but I firmly believe we exist specifically for that reason, and that the end result of what will happen to us will entirely elevate all of life to something greater.

We're part of the birth of a massive fucking entity, primarily through "globalization". A more accurate term for what I'm talking about is "convergence" - human beings are more connected than they've ever been. It's getting to the point where most all things that have plagued basic humans - hatred, war, famine - are completely gone (due to an abundance of resources), allowing people to see each other and truly truly interface. If humanity can interface together properly, we shall become a higher level being - one beyond anything we can even fucking imagine right now. All of humanity must work together to achieve this, requiring everyone to truly connect to everyone else.

True connection is a fundamental source of joy in our lives - maybe the only other fundamental source besides shit like orgasming. Even that just feels good - it's not the fundamental joy that connection brings. Everything in our lives that's good is based on connection to other people. Connecting to everyone will enable us to feel more happiness than humanity has ever felt before, with no more hatred or sadness. Everyone will be truly happy, and the best part is that this result is simply a byproduct of humanity fulfilling our ultimate purpose in life: taking the helm of life and becoming a higher level entity.

The interplay between loss of individuality and the gaining of this higher level entity-ness is the most fascinating phenomena in the world. It's a trend which governs all aspects of life, literally fucking EVERYTHING from quantum mechanics to jigsaw puzzles. idk i think i'm having trouble communicating exactly what I want to say about this, but this interplay forms the foundation for what I've been thinking about lately.

Humanity is becoming less diverse. Less culturally and individually nuanced. What was previously a beautiful wrinkled tapestry of diversity laid over the entire world is being stretched and bleached into a taut beige sheet. Unique customs and traditions from around the world are being forgotten in favor of Youtube videos with billions upon billions of views. Whereas people once interacted only with their close tribes, increasingly our voices have been connected to everyone. And we're all homogenizing. 

What I wrote above is basically the foundation of my belief as to why that is a good thing. The loss of culture, of individual gardens and tightly knit communities, is horrible. These form the traditional sources of joy and happiness humans have refined over milennea, and should certainly be preserved in some way. Even though it won't go away it will no longer be the norm. What replaces it, is something entirely new and much, much better. Exponentially so. I posit that what we gain in this new, incredible phase of transition, will far surpass everything humanity has done up to this point and irreperably improve the condition of humanity.

This is our chance to cross the boundary, people! We're peaking RIGHT NOW. WE NEED TO JUMP THROUGH THE WALL AND ASCEND TO A HIGHER PLANE!
this is the time, maybe the only time life will ever get a chance to do something like this. We need to pass this "Great Filter" - something I prefer to think of kinda like a membrane boundary. It's a transition phase, each of which forms some of the toughest periods ever in life's history. I must believe that we have the ability to make it through and that we sucessfully transition, as that is the only way we ever will succeed.

this is far more fucking important than anything else i could possibly do with my life. this takes priority over everything else. I need to tell people about this. I need to convince people to join me. Join my movement. Cultivating this movement will be the most important thing I will ever do. 

One wonders what happens if we fail. If we reject society's old ways and truly go ALL IN in this direction, and fail to establish this entity, humanity and even life might cease to exist. However, that would've happened anyways no matter what we do. Would you rather die out slowly over millenia, never having evolved beyond our closeminded ways, or go out in a blaze of glory while pursuing true meaning? The latter option provides the only possible route to humanity and life itself never ever dying out. Wither and die, or survive forever? I posit that as living creatures ourselves, the only option is clear. 

Our genes are hard-coded to help life survive for as long as possible, and propogate. This is the truest way to fulfill our mission: as living creatures, as humans working to resolve humanity's problems, and as individuals seeking true connection and meaning in our lives. This is the path.

This is how we start a space empire, people. This is how we solve all of humanity's problems, from racism to global warming to the limited resources of our planet. We need to genuinely connect together closer than anyone has before, all of us. Feel the genuine connection! Each of us contributes our part by fulfilling our nice. The concept of society gets us 90% of the way there already. However, now it's time to restructure socity in order to optimize properly and so that no one need suffer unnecessarily. It's possible to have both - indeed, my entire thesis here is that optimizing both actually must be done at once!

Join me to pursue true happiness and fulfillment. Join me to solve systemic issues on all levels. Join me, to shape the world and provide the best possible future for the entire universe and everything within it.

#### Afterword

I've been writing my thoughts on this for a long time. This is the one, the pivotal text I've been missing. It's time to write much more about this, the topic of my manifesto.

Manifesto:


Oliver is my brother in this. Carson is my brother in this. Coco is my sister in this. Shreya is my sister in this... I hope!



closing thoughts on Shreya: I have no idea if she views the world in the way I've expoused above. The above viewpoints are so fundamental to me and what I'd like to do with my life, that anyone I spend my life with will absolutely need to be 100% onboard. 

I really honestly think she will be! I think she'll have so much to add to this, and hope for her to apply her beautiful mind, which somehow remains practical while still seeing all of the beauty of the world.

in order to survive and navigate life - to become a part of life itself - one must intentionally numb themselves to the world and dull their eyes.

Shreya breaks this dichotomy, which is false. Her mind is incredibly observant, loving everything around her in my conception of her. However, she still remains practical while doing so! This is a hard thing to judge, but I guess what I'm searching for in her, what I need in a relationship, is someone who has viewed the world in the way I have, and has arrived at the same fundamental truths as me. That's more important than anything else. If she has not arrived at them, then I'd like to help her arrive at them. Failing that, we may need to separate. However, I'm optimistic about changing her viewpoint and converting her if she doesn't truly believe in this already. I genuinely believe I have the potential to start one of the largest movements of all time. I need her to be by my side while I'm doing so... I still feel as if she is my "one".

I feel like this is the decision I've thought about for years. Do I choose love, or the pursuit of something greater? I will never be able to live with myself if I give up on this dream, so my options are to break up or find a way to make both work.
