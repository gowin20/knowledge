# Journal

### Accomplishments 
- processed some feelings, starting to learn how to truly accept Shreya for who she is
- ordered some cacao
- wrapped up my thoughts on cacao for now, ready to try it and expand my knowledge upon its arrival
- played catan with my sister, michael, and oscar (but at the cost of my CS knowledge)

### Gratitude
I'm legitimately grateful that Shreya is a part of my life. She's so amazing, and I feel like I really took her for granted today / recently. I'm a fucking awesome person on my own, but she helps me feel so much less alone in this cruel world. She's a genuine companion and partner, and someone who I know always has my back no matter what. I love her, and I appreciate her SO MUCH. I can't wait to tell her that in person, but i'm going to go message her that right now.


### Health
I ate fish for dinner today again, which is unfortunate yet also not terrible. I'm still eating healthy, and my parents made it for me so I don't know how much of a choice I actually had. I'm kinda on a meat streak though, since tomorrow I'm getting mcdougal's with carter.

# Learn
not feeling very good right now, mostly because of a talk I had with Shreya recently. She says that I have these really high expectations of her and kinda expect her to fit into this mold of who I want her to be. If she doesn't meet my standards exactly then she feels like I'm super mean to her or unsatisfied.

That's honestly so true. I feel like recently I've wanted Shreya to be someone she isn't. I want her to be super nature-concious, health-concious, and practice mindfulness and gratefulness, because that's what I want to do in my own life. I need to feel enabled and supported in those goals.

I think there's a great line to draw there.
I don't need her support to do these things. I should be able to do them on my own, and the fact that I've started it all without her is proof that I am. I don't need her to live my life in order for me to live my life.

However, I need her to accept, support, and validate me in who I am. She does a pretty awesome job at that to be honest! I've always felt super supported and validated even if she doesn't share the passions she's validating.

What do I absolutely need to be shared in a relationship? Whatever that is, Shreya definitely fucking has it.

I need to embrace the concept of LIVING FOR MYSELF. I AM MY OWN PERSON, with my own interests, passions, and hobbies. I am my own person and I'm amazing and good.

This goes all the way back to my defining, which I should do again. I feel like I've matured and changed a lot since then. Maybe I didn't have a very strong sense of self. I never have.

The defining felt like me laying the absolute foundations of who I was. I was throwing words and affirmations into a black box, and now things are starting to stick and build up. That's definitely one of my favorite visuals since literally everything works in that way. Somehow my subconcious latched on and now I know who I can be. But let's paint the picture for a moment.


I'm standing tall in a brightly lit apartment, sun shining through slatted blinds. The space is clean and sleek, but brimming with personality and artistic creativity. Plants line the walls and tables, and food is growing out on the balcony. There's a yoga mat in the corner, and tapestries (obtained for cheap/free) on the ground in circles from a recent cacao ceremony.

As for me, I am George Owen. This is my space. I'm tall and skinny, with strong arms and honed legs and ass. My chest looks good and my stomach is flat. My hair is cut short, and I'm wearing cool earrings. My eyes are this deep blue, highlighted by strong eyebrows. A tall nose gives way to sleek pale lips, and my skin is a wonderful tan while still being very light. I'm wearing comfortable short shorts that have lots of color, and a patterned button down with the top few buttons left open. I am relaxed, summery, and aware. I choose to live every day with intention, which means deciding what to do and having the strength to follow through on it. I've overcome my demons and I'm able to lead a highly social life without having strange thoughts about the people around me. Shreya is lounging on the couch, and I'm sketching her on a little easel.

She has flowing dark hair dyed blue, thick lips and a beautifully shaped face. Her skin is caramel bronze, with toned legs that have soft short hairs covering them. She's wearing a flowery tank top and booty shorts, and we're looking at each other and seeing each other for who they truly are.

Daniel is on the couch next to Shreya, and she turns to him to talk and laugh. The space that I've created is enjoyed by many.

Art lines the walls, most noticably with an entire wall of post-it notes. We have a big table that people paint on as well.

Oliver and Coco are talking on a big bean bag. Fionna and Carson are painting. Ethan is hiding behind a chair and waiting to scare the next person who walks in.

Sean and I are talking about board games. We have a game of Scythe running, and Kristin and Saagarika are playing with us as well as Josh.

More people arrive to be in community with us. Claire comes with her roommate, and I end up talking to her about origami for a long time. She's awesome. David is finally here too, after being in Korea for the entire duration of covid. He brings Fabian and Jack, names I haven't heard in a long time. 

As the sun sets, we all gather around to begin the ceremony. We take our places on tapestries and cloth carefully arranged on the ground, and Oliver passes out cups that he's made himself. Shreya and I duck into the kitchen to fetch the Cacao, used to assemble a ritual drink. 

As the water boils, we begin to talk about being in community with each other. It's important to feel our individual souls, and understand the fundamental connection we all share. We are all individuals, but we are simultaneously one. One living being, made up of units we understand individually but struggle to comprehend as a collective. Just as all levels of life are made from separate units coming together to form something greater, life itself is converging and becoming aware. Humans, plants, dogs, cats, even insects form the units in a greater entity which we are tasked to facilitate. Individual lifeforms move and function like the cells of our body: blood cells rushing through our veins, or skin cells protecting and enabling what lies within. As human beings, we are tasked to act as the brain of life on earth. Our heightened minds can comprehend more than other species, and we've used this power to take the reigns of earth into our own hands. Humanity has total control over life, and it's our sacred duty to understand that and guide the planet in a beneficial direction. That's our truest intention.

My intention in this moment is to frame this task not as a burden, but as the greatest gift in the world. Being a guide necessitates a holistic approach to all of this, which begins with genuine appreciation and gratitude. The only path to saving the world is to genuinely understand, observe, and appreciate all aspects of it. That begins here, in community with each other. Sharing stories, sharing experiences, and opening our lives to each other allows us to understand more about the world and intentionally connect with each other.


That's what the Cacao represents. A joining of spirits, minds, and bodies.
Each of us here is a living work of art. Our lives are beautiful, fundamentally, and the memories and experiences we create together only adds to the beauty.

Take first sip together

Each person recounts a story, experience, or feeling, followed by an intention. Imbue your next sip with that intention.

After we drink, we do something fucking wild to bring us all together.

that's when the orgy starts lol

it's life itself that we worship. Not a person, not a thing, but life itself. Our god arises from the collective of many, and exists to be shaped and experienced by all. Everyone should be truly equal in that way.
