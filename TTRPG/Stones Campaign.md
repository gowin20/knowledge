# Stones Campaign

a world featuring controllable stones. They float by default, and enable all sorts of different magic items + equiptment

- This stuff will be used to supplement the standard dungeons and dragon spells
- To account for the additional stuff, we'll ban really OP DND spells such as Teleportation (or at least make them difficult to obtain!)

# Characters

- Initial directive of the player characters
- key NPCs
    - placed dynamically depending on what the players do
    - revolution head
        - perhaps have kinda shitty qualities about themselves as well
    - queen with a figurehead king
    - captain of the guard
    - corrupt politician (trump)
    - main starter NPC
        - kill him off! or die naturally
        - tavernkeep?
        - he has to have a direction, can't be too generic
        - appears important to the story
    - 2 other NPCs known from the start - people associated with the guard and the revolutionaries
    - robert villian
- establish goals for the characters, instead of a plot
- build a world + people that interact within the world

# The World / Opportunities

- Players can choose between the rebels and the king.

Flat Earth

A small kingdom

Round Earthers

"mountainous cultures"

- less trusting
- spartan in order to survive
- very dangerous environment
- very isolated culture
- ^^^ esp. for lower classes
- Revolutionaries are like this. They go too far in that direction, being libertarian dicks

Let people choose what they want to do!

flesh out puzzles and detail stuff the week before the meeting

- multiple contacts for quests and objectives
- introductory quest-giver who is pretty nice

# Additional Maps

### End Goal

- Discover the huge "higher civilization" which is out there (the natural next step for humanoid magical civilization)
- basically, the entire campaign up to this point took place in one of their trading outposts. The "king" of this kingdom is just a duke of the larger area
- In fact, the entire "edge of the world" was created by them to isolate themselves from the rest of the world. It's still really deep and scary though
- take down the entire flying culture
- assimilate to them
