man, I hate my body sometimes.

It's 1:52am and I wanted to go to bed half an hour ago. However, I'm so incredibly afraid of peeing the bed that I've stayed up for an extra half hour

additionally, I have this thing where I feel like I have to pee constantly. It sucks, and it's here right now.

Usually it's fine but once in a while (well like HONESTLY at least once every two weeks) it really affects my ability to sleep. I get up, go to the bathroom, then go back in bed and somehow immediately feel like i need to pee again

I feel like I have to pee right now, and I just went to the bathroom. I literally have no idea how to fix this. It's one of the symptoms of a UTI I believe, which I should certainly go get checked out for.


In my mind this is also linked to the problem with my dick head. I've got this flap of skin which covers about half of my urethra, and prevents me from peeing properly / constantly causes me some discomfort and pain. I need to seriously, seriously see a doctor and get it checked out.

It's so scary though! literally like I'm scared of what's going to happen to me. Am I going to get surgery? will it be removed?
I've considered slicing the flap of skin in half with a scalpel myself. I've thought about that a lot. Or just snipping it with scissors. It would probably hurt like hell and cause a lot of bleeding, and might not heal properly
fuck! I should seriously just go to a doctor shouldn't I


Is that really linked to my consistent problem with peeing the bed?

Are these linked to my feeling like I constantly need to go to the bathroom?

I feel like my urinary system is just fucked up in a couple of different ways. This is the kind of thing that I need to address during this quarter of college, since it's the quarter of self-care and self-improvement. That would be a great way to take care of myself :)
