To be clear, I don't think he's a good person. However, I think that his continual awareness of talent and "knowing what the next big thing is"

He's aware of the talent in the people around him. That's what I care about the most. I want to find other talented people, people who really GET IT, and bring them together. I think some of the most amazing things in the world could happen if that actually worked.
Honestly, there's probably something like that already. Or at least something to build off of.


He's also really good at controlling narratives. He takes stories and makes them HIS, which is like the KEY component of all marketing. Cobble needs to be attention-grabbing and charming like Sean Parker

HE IS A VISIONARY

that's truly why I appreciate him. Sean Parker is one of the most visionary people I've seen in media, in terms of the raw "I can tell the future"

i feel like when I do acid I really almost gain the ability to see such a large picture. The different network of brain activity leads to a different kind of thinking,
