# Brad's Playing Cards

# GOAL:

Make a 52-card deck which serves as a customized alternative to the popular drinking game "Kings"

### Each card in the deck will:

- Contain a rule instructing the player to do something involving drinking
- Contain pictures of people in our friend group in a manner which is RELEVANT to the rule

### The game as a whole will be:

- FUN TO PLAY.
    - Each rule has to be fun! I want this to be fun
- APPLICABLE to a broad audience.
    - While the focus is on inside jokes, the game must have a shelf life. I want to be able to play this game with (some) people who are not in Brad's
- REPLAYABLE
    - The game should be as replayable as "Kings"
    - This means that it shouldn't rely on any one-time gimmicks
