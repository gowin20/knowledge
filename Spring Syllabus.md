Sober for the last two weeks of winter as I figure out my entire life. acid over spring break!

totally sober until i do acid?

no alcohol would be a good idea

maybe still do some weed? idk though

no moree drugs or alcohol right now. Not until at least after my cartoraphy project is in on wednesday

Next week, i'll take acid

ha!

take acid and lay foundations of cobble. must be AFTER my manifesto

write my manifesto

that's a big deal. It needs to encapsulate my desire to

-   bring people together
-   change the social dynamic at UCLA forever and for better
-   create an institution solely dedicated to creation
-   focus on elevating ourselves and the people around us

creation is the greatest good that anyone can ever do
