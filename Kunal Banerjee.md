# Kunal

Kunal is a funny and talented student. He's in Middle school right now and lives in the Bay Area. He plays lots of video games including minecraft and call of duty, enjoys scrolling on reddit, and is an active member of the community r/wallstreetbets.

As far as learning computer science, Kunal has good intuition for things like conditionals and loops. He has never coded at all before this class, however, so some things do not come very easily. We've spent a long time in Python Level 2, and while Kunal has come a LONG way he still struggles sometimes. In particular, he always finds strings and indexing to be challenging, as well as the range() syntax for "for" loops. He's gotten a lot better recently though, and continued practice is the key to success.

Kunal has trouble paying attention in class. He's pretty good at hiding it, but I can definitely tell when he is not fully engaged. It's a hard line to walk; sometimes he doesn't understand things because he is genuinely confused and sometimes he doesn't understand because he isn't paying attention. I've found that positive reinforcement works well, as well as setting expectations for attentiveness at the start of class. Make sure his camera is on and actually pointed at him so that there's some accountability. He has two monitors, and I've noticed that he will sometimes be looking at his second monitor instead of paying attention - make sure to encourage him to pay attention in that case.

A good instructor for Kunal will
* Share common interests / a good sense of humor
* Make sure he understands concepts intuitively, ask him to explain his work
* Make sure that he stays fully engaged through positive reinforcement, accountability, and expectation setting
