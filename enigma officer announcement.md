I've got a VERY exciting announcement! The end of the year is approaching, and it's time to start thinking about what comes next. **Let's talk about officer positions for next year.**

For the past many years, Enigma has been an oligarchy. The current officers choose the officers for next year, usually finding their own replacements. This was a low maintenance way of doing things, but the club has surprisingly grown quite a bit over the past year. I'm pleased to announce that **for the first time in a long time, Enigma officer positions are now open to applications!** This is our first step in a multi-year transition to fully democratic elections. Current officers have been invited to stay on, but open positions can be filled by anyone!

I want everyone here to consider the implications of becoming an Enigma officer for next year. Fall quarter will be the first in-person quarter in over a year. The **majority** of students at UCLA will have never been to school on campus. Hell, most active members of this club have never even seen other in real life!

Going back to campus is going to be absolutely amazing. I'm looking forward to that first meeting already - everyone finally seeing each other irl and playing board games together is going to be magical. This next year will see many new members joining, with everyone eager to have all that fun they missed out on over the past year. With a small recruitment push, Enigma is positioned to become a large and influential club on campus.

Becoming an Enigma officer is the perfect way to capture your zeitgeist at UCLA. If you've been drifting for the past year and want to actually do something, this is a perfect chance. If you've been online your entire college career and need to meet new friends, this is a perfect chance. If you want an opportunity to genuinely cultivate something amazing, this is a perfect chance.

Of course, being a member of Enigma does all of that as well. But if you're an officer you get mod on this discord sooooooo... you know what to do.

So go! Become an officer, and help shape Enigma for the future. The link to apply is in #announcements
